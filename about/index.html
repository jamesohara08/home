    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm James O'Hara if you didn't see that in the giant banner. I've been @nextyeardc and briefly @thisyeardc on social media since 2011. I used to write a lot about the Nats and then they got pretty boring the last five years. While getting rid of some old computers I realized I had a lot of old Word docs of articles and posts that have long since lost their home on the internet. So I decided to write a script to convert those word docs into HTML and build my own site to host these stories (if you're interested in this for yourself let me know!), the web apps I've made and anything I plan to do in the future. My hope is that future includes new posts about the Nats, Caps, Hokies, Commanders, Mystics and whatever else seems interesting. Thank you to Max Duchaine who made the original version of the site banner in 2014 that I've lightly edited to fit the content here. If you like what you see and you don't know me, please follow me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nextyeardc.bsky.social">BlueSky</a>.</p>

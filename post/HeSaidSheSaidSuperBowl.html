<h1>He Said She Said Super Bowl</h1><b>January 30, 2014 Originally published in Collegiate Times with companion She Said</b><p>You won’t find anything more American than the Super Bowl. A sport that the rest of the world refers to as American football and over-commercialization that would even make Black Friday advertisers blush. It truly has it all. </p><p>As sports editor, I am required to enjoy the football aspect the most, but that doesn’t stop me from loving everything that makes the Super Bowl what it is. </p><p>Despite the supposed warnings of 1988 cult movie classic “They Live” I see no problems with the over-commercialization of society, especially when it comes to the big productions that are Super Bowl advertisements.</p><p>My parents were the founders of the Society for the Commercialization of Christmas, so a love for the gaudy excess of the Super Bowl is inherited. </p><p>Speaking of my family, this leads me to my second non-football love of the Super Bowl, the food. My family started a tradition in 2004 by having a big dinner made up of foods local to the teams in the big game. </p><p>It’s a great way to try some new foods you might not otherwise and, let’s face it, any excuse to eat way too much delicious food is a good one. </p><p>Super Bowl Sunday is essentially a national holiday, just without the time off of work or school. In other words, if you’re watching the game alone, you’ve messed up. </p><p>This season the big game is in New York City, or that’s what the National Football League desperately hopes you think. It’s really in a truly depressing place called East Rutherford, NJ. </p><p>New Jersey is bad enough on its own, but in the winter it is too cold to be hosting such an important event. If I was made commissioner of the NFL, the game would never leave New Orleans. All national sporting events should be held in New Orleans. </p><p>The game itself should be a great one. Both Seattle and Denver are excellent teams and deserve to be playing for it all. We’ve enjoyed a nice run of six straight good, close Super Bowl games and I expect this one to be no different. </p><p>So gather some friends and food, pile around the television and celebrate everything that make America great.</p>

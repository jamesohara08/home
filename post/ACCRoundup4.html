<h1>ACC Roundup 4</h1><b>September 25, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Let it be known that in week 4, every ACC team playing an out of conference opponent won. Fire up the “A-C-C” chants, this is your ACC Roundup.</p><p>Clemson 26 NC State 14: With Clemson going into the half with just a 13-7 lead and the offense looking stagnant, there were some whispers of Clemsoning. A lucky incorrect out of bounds call on an NC State touchdown run and subsequent fumble by the Wolfpack was all the momentum the Tigers needed to pull out a victory in Raleigh. </p><p>Georgia Tech 28 North Carolina 20: Bryn Renner was his usual self, passing for an okay 218 yards and two touchdowns. Renner is the type of guy who would drive exactly the speed limit because “they have one for a reason.” The Yellow Jackets meanwhile ran for their usual 324 yards and threw in a passing touchdown just to let you know they can if they want to. </p><p>Pittsburgh 58 Duke 55: Wrapping up in-conference action, it was not a good week for the Triangle. The Panthers meanwhile clearly forgot to read their orientation materials and played a close game against Duke. Panthers quarterback Tom Savage tied an ACC record with six touchdown passes, which is just rude after joining so recently.</p><p>Maryland 37 West Virginia 0: The Terrapins got out to their best start to a season since 2001, while the Mountaineers suffered their first shutout since then. CJ Brown continued to quietly impress, completing 65% of his passes while rushing and passing for a touchdown. </p><p>Miami 77 Savannah State 7</p><p>Florida State 54 Bethune-Cookman 6: Ranked Florida squad demolished a completely overmatched opponent in a true test of how much punishment a school is willing to take for a six-figure paycheck. Ranked Florida squad took the opportunity to get their backups some game experience, while overmatched opponent cowered in a corner. </p><p>Virginia 49 VMI 0: Desperate for some in-state competition they can actually beat, the Cavaliers ran roughshod over the Keydets. The Cavalier defense gave up just 79 total yards while shutting out the Keydets, which inspired Cavalier fans everywhere to wonder how that compared to holding Alabama to 206 yards. Keep dreaming guys. </p><p>Syracuse 52 Tulane 17: Because teams are obligated these days to play 12 regular season games, Syracuse played Tulane. Tulane quarterback Nick Montana is certainly not his father Joe, as the Green Wave passing attack managed just 5.6 yards per completion. The win was the 700th in the history of Syracuse football. </p><p>Wake Forest 25 Army 11: Again Wake Forest seems to find another new and interesting team to lose to- wait what? The Demon Deacons tried their best, trailing 11-10 late in the third quarter, but managed to pull out a victory. With the Demon Deacons facing Clemson next week, all should be right in the world.</p><p>That’s it for this week in ACC action and remember #goacc. </p>

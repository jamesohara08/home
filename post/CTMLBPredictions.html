<h1>CT MLB Predictions</h1><b>October 30, 2012 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>With a 4-3 victory in 10 innings on Sunday the San Francisco Giants clinched a four game sweep over the Detroit Tigers in the World Series, claiming their second title in just three years and putting an exciting 2012 season in the books.</p><p>Now as the offseason begins, baseball fans’ eyes turn to the 2013 season.  Here are some things you the fan can expect to see next year.</p><p>Those World Series champion Giants can be expected to compete once again in the National League West after returning every key piece from their 2012 run.  However, they could have some competition from the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks.</p><p>The Dodgers have some serious star power in Matt Kemp, Adrian Gonzalez, Clayton Kershaw, and Hanley Ramirez, but there are some questions about who will truly make up this team come next April.  Likewise, the Diamondbacks have some questions to answer about whether or not they will hold on to star outfielder Justin Upton.</p><p>Altogether look for the Giants --with their greater stability-- to capture the Western division pennant again.</p><p>In the Central look for a battle between the dominant Cincinnati Reds, contending St. Louis Cardinals, and upstart Pittsburgh Pirates.  After getting close the last two years expect the Pirates to finally break through with a winning record for the first time since 1992.  </p><p>As always you cannot count out the Cardinals, even without top pitcher Kyle Loshe and some aging stars, the Cardinals can always be found in the thick of competition.</p><p>However neither team will be able to deal with the pure star power that is coming out of Cincinnati. A healthy Joey Votto and Brandon Phillips, as well as a full year of rookie sensation Todd Frazier presents a line-up that will strike fear into the hearts of even the best pitchers. Look for another repeat performance by the Reds in the Central.</p><p>The closest race in the National League next year is likely to come from the East where the young and talented Washington Nationals and Atlanta Braves will duel it out again.  Both teams have some questions to answer in the offseason such as where Adam LaRoche and Michael Bourn end up.  </p><p>However both teams are littered with enough young talent to propel them to the playoffs next year.  For the division winner, look for the Nationals to squeak it out, their rotation of Stephen Strasburg, Jordan Zimmermann, Gio Gonzalez, and Ross Detwiler is just too powerful.</p><p>In the American League the big question will be if the unexpected playoff participants Oakland Athletics and Baltimore Orioles can come close to repeating their success next year. As well as how the big money teams -- Rangers, Angels, Yankees, Tigers, and Red Sox, will recover.</p><p>In the West the Athletics are the real deal; with young sluggers Yoenis Cespedes and Josh Reddick the A’s have enough firepower to support a superb rotation.  Offseason addition Chris Young should give them one of the best outfield defenses in the league.</p><p>Before last season many compared the Angels and Rangers to the mid-2000’s Yankees and Red Sox, suggesting this may be the new big money rivalry.  That didn’t really get off the ground as the Angels missed the playoffs and Rangers faltered down the stretch and lost the Wild Card game.</p><p>Both teams should be expected to compete again next year, however prospective losses of Josh Hamilton for the Rangers, and Zack Greinke and Dan Haren for the Angels, will hamper them. Still the remaining stars on both teams will be more than enough to put a playoff spot in reach.</p><p>After a misfire last season, expect to see the Angels take the crown in this division; however both the A’s and Rangers should be in prime position to grab those two Wild Card spots.</p><p>In the Central the powerhouse Detroit Tigers should be able to easily repeat as division champions.  The Chicago White Sox and young Kansas City Royals could present a challenge to their reign, but don’t count on it.</p><p>Triple Crown winners Justin Verlander and Miguel Cabrera will lead the way as the Tigers navigate through a fairly easy division.</p><p>The AL East presents the most difficult division to read. The Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox could easily jump to the top of the division, while the Orioles could easily be a one-hit wonder.  Meanwhile the Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees should contend, but could suffer some offseason losses that tamper those expectations.</p><p>You can usually count on the Yankees to be near the top of the East, and they have probably the best chance to be there again, but don’t be surprised to see any of the other four teams in the division there instead.</p><p>After an exciting 2012 season that saw some new playoff teams in the Orioles, Nationals, and A’s, 2013 should be able to top it.  Next season should be one of the most competitive years in recent memory, and with 10 playoffs spots it should be a dog fight to the finish.  </p>

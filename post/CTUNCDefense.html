<h1>CT UNC Defense</h1><b>October 03, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>In 2012 the Virginia Tech Hokies football team began their ACC play in earnest with a trip to Chapel Hill, North Carolina to face the University of North Carolina and their new head coach Larry Fedora. </p><p>The Hokies were shellacked by the Tar Heels new up-tempo offense, giving up 48 points on 533 total yards, 339 of those gained on the ground, in route to a 48-34 loss. </p><p>“They just hammered us,” said head coach Frank Beamer. “So they certainly got our attention and our respect on that deal.” </p><p>The key player in the game was running back Giovani Bernard, who had 262 yards rushing on 23 carries and a touchdown.</p><p>“Everybody saw the game, Bernard just ran the ball on us,” said defensive lineman Derrick Hopkins.</p><p>Bernard is off to the greener pastures of the NFL, but Fedora and his spread system that gashed the Hokies defense is still here. </p><p>The spread offense is the big buzzword in college football, but no other team runs the spread quite like Fedora and the Tar Heels. In comparison to the pass happy attacks, like those at Marshall or East Carolina, or run happy attacks, like the ones ran by Cam Newton or Denard Robinson, the Tar Heels preach balance.</p><p>The Tar Heels utilize a simple single-back spread concept, while running a no-huddle system to introduce variety and get defenses on their heels. </p><p>Another twist to the Tar Heels system is that despite running spread staples such as the “zone read” or “inverted veer”, they do not rely on a mobile quarterback. Instead, the quarterback is used as a decoy to keep the defense honest, while they stretch the field to get their running backs out in space. </p><p>When run with a talented back like Bernard the system was a smash hit in its first season in 2012. The Tar Heels averaged 40.6 points per game, while passing for 291 yards per game and rushing for 193 yards per game. </p><p>The balance was the key. Most college offenses choose one aspect to excel at predominantly, allowing the defense to load up against it. Faced with an attack that both ran and passed the ball well, while also spreading the field and moving at a fast pace, defenses crumbled. </p><p>“They’re very capable of attacking in a lot of different ways,” said defensive coordinator Bud Foster. </p><p>As long as there are playmakers on offense, the defense needs to play its roles perfectly, often on an island, to succeed against the Tar Heels. Open field tackling is key for the defense, if the offensive player can make the first guy miss, they will have lots of room to work with. </p><p>Last season the Hokies struggled with that and the Tar Heels took advantage. </p><p>“I mean honestly, we didn’t execute, we weren’t doing our responsibilities,” said linebacker Jack Tyler.</p><p>“We didn’t tackle very well. I don’t think our guys were comfortable enough in their fits on the perimeter -- because that’s where all the big plays came out of in the run game,” said Foster. </p><p>This season things have not gone so well for the Tar Heels, who have missed having a playmaker like Bernard at running back. </p><p>Despite calling a nearly identical amount of running plays as in 2012, the Tar Heels have averaged 93 fewer yards per game in 2013. </p><p>The problems in the running game have carried over to their passing attack as well. While they are averaging about the same amount of yards per game as in 2012 -296 - quarterback Bryn Renner has seen his completion percentage drop from 65.4 percent in 2012 to 59.9 percent this year. </p><p>Renner has also seen his touchdown to interception ratio drop, from 4.00 in 2012, to 2.33 in 2013. All of this has added up to the Tar Heels averaging 25.3 points per game, 15 points less than they did in 2012. </p><p>That does not mean that the Hokies are taking them lightly though. They remember the difficulties they have had with spread concepts and no-huddle offenses in the past. </p><p>“They’ve got talent along the offensive line, everywhere, great skill, they’re good. They put a lot of yards on us a year ago and it’s embarrassing,” said defensive line coach Charley Wiles.</p><p>That said the Hokies feel more prepared for the Tar Heels this time around. </p><p>“I hope going into it playing the no-huddle teams that we’ve played will help us,” said Foster. </p><p>“It’s extra motivation, we’ve just got to keep doing what we’ve been doing and working hard and trying to play consistently and try to get better,” Hopkins said.  </p>

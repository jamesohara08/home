<h1>CT Caps</h1><b>April 16, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>On March 19th the Washington Capitals lost to their rival, the Pittsburgh Penguins, 2-1. The loss dropped them to 12-16-1 and their 25 points were good for second-to-last in the Eastern Conference, seven points out of a playoff spot.</p><p>Since that loss the Capitals have won 11 of their last 13 contests, including a current seven-game winning streak, and find themselves four points ahead of Winnipeg for the Southeast Division lead.</p><p>When the hot streak began after the loss to the Penguins the Capitals had a 93.8% chance of missing the playoffs, according to Sports Club Stats. Today, the Capitals have a 92.1% chance of making the playoffs, a startling turnaround.</p><p>The streak begins with the Capitals’ star player Alexander Ovechkin, who has been playing like it’s 2009. Ovechkin is the current leading goal-scorer in the NHL with 27 and is on the short list to win the Hart Memorial Trophy for the NHL’s most valuable player.</p><p>Before the hot streak began Ovechkin had taken much criticism from fans and hockey analysts alike, often being dubbed “washed up.” Now he is one of the hottest players in the league, scoring 15 goals in the Capitals’ last 13 games. Ovechkin is so hot that his nine power-play goals just since March 5th would lead the league.</p><p>The man who deserves the credit for helping Ovechkin find his groove is new head coach Adam Oates. Oates, a former star for the Washington Capitals, took over the team after another former Capital, Dale Hunter, stepped down as coach following last season.</p><p>Despite a rocky start, Oates has really come into his own as a coach and the players are clearly responding well to his style. Oates has helped turn a Captials’ power-play that ranked 16th and 18th in the last two years into the best power-play in the league, converting on 25.5% of their power-play opportunities. </p><p>And Ovechkin isn’t doing it all on his own. The Capitals are the only team with three players in the top 15 in the NHL in points. Along with Ovechkin is the two top centers Nicklas Backstrom and Mike Ribeiro. Both centers have no problem with distributing the puck as they are each in the top 10 in the NHL in assists. </p><p>With the season ending on April 27 the Capitals should be one of the hottest teams heading into the playoffs. However, not everything is sunshine and roses for the Southeast Division leader.</p><p>Of concern is the Capitals’ lackluster defense. In their last game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Capitals got out to a quick 5-1 lead before giving up four goals to the Lightning to tie the game and head to overtime, where they managed to pull out the win.</p><p>Overall the Capitals defense ranks 20th in goals against average and is second-to-last in penalty kill percentage.  Primary goaltender Braden Holtby is 31st, out of 30 teams, in goals against average at 2.72 goals per game. </p><p>As the saying goes “defense wins championships” and the Capitals have one of the worst defenses among playoff contenders.</p><p>Another concern is that advanced stats suggest that the Capitals are benefiting from the easy Southeast Division competition. The Capitals’ score-close Fenwick percentage, a measure of puck possession, is 47.5 this season, nearly identical to their percentage of 47.6 last season, when they lost in the second round of the playoffs.</p><p>Still a seven-game winning streak is hard to ignore and the Washington Capitals are succeeding because of their stars. Perhaps 2013 will be the year when the Capitals finally break through and make it to the Conference Finals and maybe even the Stanley Cup Finals. </p>

<h1>CT NL Preview</h1><b>October 03, 2012 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Every team in the National League playoff field is built for success in the playoffs.  Every team has a legitimate shot at taking the National League crown and the World Series bid that goes with it.</p><p>However that does not mean that these teams are equals. There is a distinct tiered hierarchy among the five playoffs teams: the elites (the Washington Nationals and Cincinnati Reds), the upper crust (the San Francisco Giants and Atlanta Braves) and the underdogs (the St. Louis Cardinals).</p><p>The top seed will be the Washington Nationals who are the Eastern Division champions after holding first place for 176 out of the 185 days of the season.  </p><p>The Nationals are the most balanced team in these playoffs both second in runs scored and runs allowed among the playoff teams.  Their +133 run differential, a basic measure of team quality, is the best in the Majors.  They are also one of the best teams in the Majors in terms of home (49-31) and away (48-33) record.</p><p>With Cy Young Candidate Gio Gonzalez, Jordan Zimmermann, Ross Detwiler, and Edwin Jackson the Nationals boast one of the best rotations in the playoffs.  Overall the team has very few holes or “breathers” for opponents on the mound or at the plate.  Every player is a threat to bring in a clutch hit or strikeout, making them a formidable opponent.</p><p>Their closest competitor will be the Cincinnati Reds the Central Division champions and their star slugger Joey Votto.  </p><p>Votto would have been a leading MVP candidate if not for a lengthy injury; however the Reds fared just as well without him going 31-15. The Reds also have some playoff experience after winning the Central in 2010, which gives them an advantage over the less experienced Nationals.</p><p>The Reds boast a multitude of all stars in Votto, 2B Brandon Phillips, OF Jay Bruce, P Mat Latos, and P Aroldis Chapman as well as a Cy Young candidate of their own in Johnny Cueto.  Like the Nationals with Bryce Harper, the Reds have their own special rookie in 1B/3B Todd Frazier, who is a Rookie of the Year contender.</p><p>At the next tier of teams the first Wild Card winner Atlanta Braves are one of the hotter teams in baseball.  After a sluggish start with serious pitching issues, the Braves have finally found a winning combination and are looking strong entering the postseason.</p><p>Their pitching is led by new starter Kris Medlen -- the Braves have won the last 23 games he’s pitched, and flame-throwing, shutdown closer Craig Kimbrel.  While on offense their outfield of Jason Heyward, Martin Prado, and Michael Bourn is the best in the game.  The Braves also have great team leadership from veterans Tim Hudson and Chipper Jones.</p><p>Despite being a Wild Card the Braves should be considered one of the favorites to reach the NLCS and possibly the postseason. However they have two large obstacles in the one and done Wild Card game, and the top seeded Nationals and Reds, against whom they are a combined 9-15.</p><p>The final division champion is the 2010 World Champion San Francisco Giants.  Like that 2010 team these Giants rely heavily on their superb pitching, with a dash of offense from MVP candidate catcher Buster Posey.</p><p>The Giants boast perhaps the best playoff rotation in Matt Cain, Madison Bumgarner, Ryan Vogelsong, and Tim Lincecum. Any time a team can list a two-time Cy Young as their 4<sup>th</sup> pitcher they have an intimidating rotation.</p><p>The Giants’ playoff chances were hurt by the loss of batting leader Melky Cabrera in August due to a 50 game suspension for use of performance enhancing drugs.  The loss of Cabrera leaves a big hole in their lineup and outfield, severely hampering their chances of going far.</p><p>The benefactors of the new Wild Card format are last year’s World Series champions the St. Louis Cardinals.  Despite the loss of future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols to free agency, the Cardinals find themselves right back in the postseason. Their +116 run differential suggests they are a better team than their record suggests.</p><p>Led by veterans such as Carlos Beltran and Chris Carpenter as well as last year’s postseason hero David Freese, the Cardinals present a pesky out for any playoff team.  Their rotation of Carpenter, Adam Wainwright, Kyle Lohse, and Lance Lynn can matchup with any other team in the playoffs.  </p><p>All things considered the favorite to reach the World Series from the National League has to be the Washington Nationals.  However don’t be surprised to see any of these other four teams their instead.</p>

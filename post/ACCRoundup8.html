<h1>ACC Roundup 8</h1><b>October 25, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>The ACC is tied for the most teams in the top 15 of the first BCS standings with the SEC and has the current number 2 team in the country. The ACC Roundup needed time to recover from the shock, so it’s a special Thursday night edition. This is your ACC Roundup. </p><p>Miami 27 – North Carolina 23: The Hurricanes nearly lost to the woeful Tar Heels, which looked like it might have qualified for the worst game by a top 10 team this weekend. Then numbers three, six, seven, eight and nine all lost and everyone forgot. Further proof that a bad win is still better than a loss.  Survive and advance, Hurricanes. </p><p>Georgia Tech 56 – Syracuse 0: The Yellow Jackets entered the game on a three-game losing streak, so of course they blew out the Orange. Quarterback Vad Lee threw just three passes, completing all three including one for a touchdown, and the Yellow Jackets rang up seven rushing touchdowns while averaging 5.9 yards per carry. If you think you know who the fifth best team in the ACC is, the ACC Roundup would love to know. </p><p>Wake Forest 34 – Maryland 10: With the win the Demon Deacons have a winning record, which is neat. To add injury to insult, the Terrapins lost both of their All-ACC caliber receivers to season ending knee injuries. During the final moments of the game Wake Forest fans chanted “A-C-C” at the departing Terrapins, which is beautiful. Well done, Demon Deacons. </p><p>Pittsburgh 35 – Old Dominion 24: It was once asked: if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? The Panthers were down 10-0 at the end of the first quarter and only up four entering the fourth on their FCS opponent, but nobody made a peep. So consider the question answered with a definitive yes. </p><p>Duke 35 – Virginia 22: With 5:49 to go in the first half the Cavaliers curiously went for two to go up 22-0 on the Blue Devils. The Blue Devils then scored 35 straight points unanswered, while the Cavaliers racked up all of seven yards in the third quarter. Head football cop Mike London is squarely on the hot seat as the loss was the Cavaliers fourth in a row. </p><p>Florida State 51 – Clemson: In one of the most anticipated games in ACC history, the Seminoles so thoroughly dominated the Tigers that most people had turned off the game by halftime. Before the game the Tigers rode around the stadium in the new Great White Fleet, but the show of power was lost on freshman sensation Jamies Winston, who threw for 444 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for another. The Seminoles face North Carolina State right after the big win, which should strike fear into Florida State fans everywhere. </p><p>That’s it for ACC action this week. Tune in next week to see if one of the top four lose, or if the ACC continues to erode their hard built reputation, and remember, #goacc. </p>

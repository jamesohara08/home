<h1>CT Triple Option</h1><b>September 25, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Perhaps no school in the nation has a more defined offensive identity than the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Head coach Paul Johnson’s triple option offense has become a staple of the ACC. </p><p>Despite the proliferation of pass-happy spread offenses, Johnson’s Yellow Jackets have rolled along with the power running attack that looks like it belongs more in 1913 than 2013, giving opposing defenses fits in the process. </p><p>Using the Flexbone formation, some calculated pre-snap motion and cut blocking the Yellow Jackets turn what appears to be a simple offense into a complex behemoth. </p><p>The Flexbone formation is made up of five down lineman, two receivers spread out wide on the line of scrimmage, the quarterback under center and three running backs flanking the quarterback and offensive tackles, creating a triangle in the backfield. </p><p>From this the Yellow Jackets have multiple options on each play of who to give the ball to. The quarterback can take it, the fullback can run it up the middle or one of the outside backs can take a pitch or sweep and get out in space. </p><p>To cover all of these options a defense has to be disciplined and stick to their assignment. The defensive linemen, linebackers and secondary must all work together to control all possible options. The keyword, according to defensive coordinator Bud Foster, is “control”. </p><p>“You got to control their run game. I don't think you can just stop their run game,” said Foster. </p><p>That’s easier said than done and it’s made even more difficult by Johnson’s ability to read a defense’s assignments and make adjustments to open new holes. Once a defense thinks it has all possible options covered, the scheme changes and they’re caught in no man’s land as a running back scampers free. </p><p>That isn’t to say that the Virginia Tech Hokies and Foster haven’t had success against the Yellow Jackets attack. </p><p>In the five games between the two teams since Johnson became head coach of the Yellow Jackets the Hokies have held them to fewer points than the Yellow Jackets averaged per game that season in every game.  In two of those games the Hokies were also able to hold the Yellow Jackets to less rushing yards than average. </p><p>“We have a lot of experience on this team that played against (Georgia) Tech last year, so I know the game plan should be pretty good for us. We’ve got the idea, we know how to play, we know how to play against them,” said junior safety Kyshoen Jarrett. </p><p>Senior cornerback Kyle Fuller has been a key cog in the Hokies defense of the Triple Option, moving in to play outside linebacker in 2010 and 2011. He will do that again this year, after the season ending injury to Ronny Vandyke in the fall left the Hokies without an outside linebacker capable of handling the responsibilities. </p><p>[KYLE FULLER QUOTE]</p><p>Despite the success in previous years, the Hokies will still have their hands full with the Yellow Jackets. It won’t be any easier with a short week to prepare after playing two high octane spread attacks in East Carolina and Marshall. </p><p>“It definitely makes it a little bit tougher, but we’re ready for it and we’re just going to start getting prepared and be ready to go,” Fuller said. </p><p>The Flexbone formation also has the receivers and backs positioned perfectly to stretch the field vertically in the passing game, following many of the same concepts of spread systems.  In previous years the Yellow Jackets have not done this, the most passing touchdowns a Yellow Jacket quarterback has had under Johnson is 11. </p><p>However, starting quarterback Vad Lee has shown an ability to throw the football as well, already passing for seven touchdowns while completing 56.4% of his passes. </p><p>“To me, he’s a similar guy to who they had last year, I think. You know, maybe a little bit more of an accurate thrower. That seems like that’s something they’re doing a little bit more is a play action pass and stuff with this guy,” Foster said. </p><p>Foster and the Hokies defense are up to the challenge though. </p><p>“We just got to be sound in our option principles, who’s got dive, who’s got quarterback, who’s your pitch player,” Foster said.  “Our linebackers, or corners, we have to do a good job keeping our feet and staying on our feet and keeping their leverage.”</p><p>“Short week or if we played them on Saturday, it doesn’t matter. We’re going to go out there and play,” Jarrett said. </p>

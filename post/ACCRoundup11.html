<h1>ACC Roundup 11</h1><b>November 13, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>With Virginia Tech’s win over Miami this weekend the Coastal Division became a muddled mess and no one knows who the best team in the ACC is after Florida State and Clemson. If you think you know who the third best team in the ACC is, write it down on a piece of paper, throw it away and try not to think about it. You’ll be glad you did. This is your ACC Roundup. </p><p>Florida State 59 – Wake Forest 3: Demon Deacons starting quarterback Tanner Price threw three interceptions on four attempts before being replaced by Tyler Cameron, who tossed three interceptions of his own. With all the concern over bullying in football recently it’s a wonder why this game was allowed to occur in the first place. Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves. </p><p>Pittsburgh 28 – Notre Dame21: The Fighting Irish got an early start on being part-time ACC member by dropping one to a Panthers squad that was coming off loses to Virginia Tech, Navy and Georgia Tech and a narrow victory over Old Dominion. Panthers quarterback Tom Savage was only sacked once and it turned out he can be pretty good when not running for his life, throwing for 243 yards and two touchdowns. </p><p>Duke 38 – NC State 20: The Blue Devils were only up four on the Wolfpack with three minutes to go in the game when they decided to turn on the cheat codes. Two consecutive DeVon Edwards pick sixes later and the Blue Devils were on their way to victory. The victory was the Blue Devils seventh, which gave them their first winning season since 1994, so yes, David Cutcliffe is a wizard. Bow down to your new mystical overlord. </p><p>Syracuse 20 – Maryland 3: The Orange’s last three weeks are this ACC season in a nutshell. They lost to Georgia Tech 56-0 and then allowed only three points combined to Wake Forest and Maryland. The Terrapins meanwhile are still looking for that elusive sixth win for bowl eligibility after failing their first three attempts at it. Luckily, Homer Simpson has some wise <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhjGoaKf52s">words</a> for the Terrapins. </p><p>Boston College 48 – New Mexico State 34: Eagles running back Andre Williams finally got that school record he missed by a yard earlier this season, rushing for 295 yards. Meanwhile, Chase Rettig had perhaps the best game of his career against in the Aggies, passing for 230 yards and three touchdowns and no interceptions. That tied for the most touchdowns Rettig has thrown without an interception. He also accomplished this “feat” against Massachusetts in 2011 and Maine in 2012, the 230 yards were the most he’s had in such a game.</p><p>North Carolina 45 – Virginia 14: Somebody should probably call the Charlottesville fire department because Head Ball Cop Mike London’s seat is on fire. The good news for London was that the Tar Heels were so far ahead he didn’t have to worry about bungling the late game clock management. Tar Heels fans meanwhile are excited about their three game winning streak but loudly declared “lalala I can’t hear you” when it was brought up that they only beat Boston College, NC State and Virginia. </p><p>That’s it for this past week in ACC action, remember #goacc. </p>

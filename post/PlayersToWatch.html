<h1>Players To Watch</h1><b>March 20, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Kelly Olynyk </p><p>The top ranked Gonzaga Bulldogs are led by seven-foot redshirt junior Kelly Olynyk and his flowing locks. Olynyk has vaulted himself into the national Player of the Year conversation by leading the Bulldogs with 17.5 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. Gonzaga has only played three games against top 25 teams, but in those games Olynyk’s averaged 17 points.</p><p>Aaron Craft</p><p>Aaron Craft of Ohio State comes into this tournament with a wealth of tournament experience already. In his freshman year as a sixth man he set a school record for assists in a game with 15 in a tournament game against George Mason. Last season Craft helped lead the Buckeyes to the Final Four, averaging 10.4 points and 5.2 assists per game. This season has been much of the same as he’s averaged 9.9 points and 4.6 assists per game while playing stout defense.</p><p>Kendall Williams</p><p>The New Mexico Lobos are the best team you probably haven’t heard of and they are led by junior point guard Kendall Williams. Williams was named the 2013 Mountain West Player of the Year and is Cousy Award finalist for the nation’s top point guard. Williams averaged 13.5 points and 5 assists per game while playing 34.5 minutes. He has shown the ability to take over a game, scoring 46 points in a win against then-No. 22 Colorado St.</p><p>Victor Oladipo</p><p>The Indiana Hoosiers started the season with a national Player of the Year candidate in Cody Zeller and end the season with an entirely different Player of the Year candidate in Victor Oladipo. Oladipo, a junior, exploded on the scene scoring 13.6 points and grabbing 6.4 rebounds per game while leading the Hoosiers to a one seed. Oladipo excels against top competition with his five highest scoring games coming against top 25 teams.</p><p>Shane Larkin</p><p>The coach’s choice for ACC Player of the Year Shane Larkin led the experienced Miami Hurricanes squad to regular season and postseason ACC Championships. Larkin -- son of baseball Hall of Famer Barry Larkin, averaged 14.4 points per game while being named to the All-ACC Defensive Team. Larkin is shooting with a hot hand; he averaged 23.7 points per game in his three ACC tournament games.</p><p>James Southerland</p><p>James Southerland of the Syracuse Orange stepped into a bigger role this year and excelled. Southerland, a senior, played 29.1 minutes per game – an increase of 13 minutes over last season, and averaged 13.9 points per game. Southerland has made his name though by stroking from behind the arc, making 40.6% of his three-pointers this season. That success shined in the Big East Tournament by draining 19 three-pointers, a new tournament record.</p><p>Doug McDermott</p><p>Doug McDermott is the rare college basketball player, a national Player of the Year candidate from a mid-major school. The Creighton Bluejays forward is one of the most prolific scorers in the country averaging 23.1 points per game. McDermott is also talented on the glass grabbing 7.5 rebounds per game. However, McDermott has not faced a single top 25 opponent this season, so the tournament will be his first real test.</p><p>Marcus Smart</p><p>One of the best freshmen in the country played his games in Stillwater, Oklahoma this year. Oklahoma State’s Marcus Smart made an immediate impact averaging 15.4 points, 5.7 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game. Smart was rewarded for his performance, garnering the Big 12 Player of the Year award as well as the Integris Wayman Tisdale Award as the nation’s top freshman. </p><p>Seth Curry</p><p>Son of Virginia Tech Hokie great Dell Curry and brother of NBA star Stephen Curry, Seth Curry of the Duke Blue Devils is looking to forge his own path. Curry -- a first team All-ACC pick by the coaches, averaged 17 points per game while helping lead the Blue Devils to a two seed. A transfer from Liberty, Curry was part of the Duke team that was upset by the 15<sup>th</sup>-seeded Lehigh last year and will be looking for more success this year.</p>

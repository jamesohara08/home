<h1>CT Jack Tyler</h1><b>October 26, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Jack Tyler</p><p>It’s not the end of the world, we just have to execute better, make more plays, do more of the right things.</p><p>(On Duke) They’re a lot better than they used to be, I mean everyone knew that coming in. They’re so well coached, Cutcliffe is a great coach. We prepared for how good they were gonna be, but we didn’t make enough plays to be honest, that was probably our biggest problem.</p><p>(On all the low scoring, close games) I mean every game’s a different game, but defensive wise we just have to make plays with whatever field position is put upon us, whatever situation is put upon us, we have to do our part. We don’t let them score a touchdown there we win the game. That’s the most disheartening part, you can put that loss on us too. I know statistically, maybe score wise, it doesn’t seem like the defense played that badly, but we could’ve done better, we could’ve done more to get a win for our team. </p><p>(On Kendall)I mean with just a week of learning boundary corner, I can’t speak highly enough of him. Like I’ve said before, he’s not a freshman, he plays like a wily veteran. He’s good, he’s really good. </p><p>(On first three quarters)I don’t know, I don’t think defensive wise we were that bad. </p><p>(On first three quarters)I guess for the first half, their kicker made two great kicks, I mean great kicks in this weather, both 50+ yarders. But it still goes down to that touchdown, we don’t let them score, we win the game. </p><p>(On Cody) We wouldn’t be anywhere that we’ve been in the past without Cody. There was that last one, there was a little bit of pressure, I think it even got tipped, so that’s not his fault. It’s tough, sometimes they don’t go your way. But we have confidence in Cody, he’s a senior leader and we’re going to need him going forward, so knowing Cody his head will be held high, he’ll be fine. </p><p>We have everything that we want in front of us. We can still go to the ACC Championship, we can still achieve those goals. I believe everyone was talking about, we could make a run here and maybe go to the ‘ship, but that was probably a little distant anyways. Our goals are still in front of us. We can still do a lot of the things that we wanted to achieve at the beginning of the season. We’re just going to have to play a lot better, get a lot better, work harder and do the little things right. </p>

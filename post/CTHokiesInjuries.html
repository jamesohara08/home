<h1>CT Hokies Injuries</h1><b>August 25, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Looking for a bounce back year after finishing 7-6 in 2012 and starting off the season against two-time defending national champion Alabama, the Virginia Tech football team wasn’t helped by a rash of injuries during fall practice. </p><p>The biggest piece the Hokies will miss going into the season is All-ACC Second-Team cornerback Antone Exum. Exum tore his ACL and lateral meniscus in his right knee earlier in January and his chances of recovering in time for the start of the season were slim to begin with. Exum worked hard to get back in time for the season opener in Atlanta, but was unable to get back to full health. </p><p>Without Exum and with the transfer of sophomore corner Donaldven Manning, the Hokies will have to rely on two true freshmen, Kendall Fuller and Brandon Facyson, to carry the starting load to begin the season. Fuller and Facyson were both highly rated recruits and have gotten good reviews in fall practice, but it remains to be seen whether they can get close to matching Exum.</p><p>During the fall the Hokies lost another defensive starter and their top playmaker in outside linebacker Ronny Vandyke. Vandyke suffered from a right shoulder injury that required surgery, keeping him out for the entire 2013 season and making him just probably for spring practice in 2014. </p><p>The loss hurts a Hokie linebacker corps that was shaping up to be one of the better groups they’ve had the last few years. On top of that the Hokies do not have a great candidate to fill-in for Vandyke. Currently, redshirt sophomore Josh Trimble is listed as the new number one on the depth chart, but it is unknown how much playing time he will truly have. </p><p>The running backs were hit hard this fall as well, with co-starter JC Coleman and backup Tony Gregory both suffering injuries. </p><p>Gregory re-tore his left ACL, it is serious enough for the Tech training staff to say that his career is effectively over. While Gregory was unlikely to make much of an impact on offense, he was a key member of the special teams unit and hurts the Hokies depth at running back. </p><p>In an odd situation Coleman sprained both of his ankles this fall. He has a left high ankle sprain and a right regular ankle sprain. At the time of the injury being announced the Hokies said they believed that he would be ready for the season opener against Alabama, however they cautioned that it was an optimistic projection. Everything that has been reported so far has Coleman on track to fulfill that goal. </p><p>Finally offensive lineman Mark Shuman, a likely starter at left tackle on a volatile offensive line, had a torn left meniscus in his left knee that required surgery to repair it. Shuman is expected to be out for four-to-six weeks and he is expected to return in full. </p><p>With the injury to Shuman, true freshman Jonathan McLaughlin will start the season at left tackle. According to the Virginia Tech Athletics Communication Office he will be the first true freshman to start the season opener at either tackle position under head coach Frank Beamer. </p><p>Additionally, true freshman Wyatt Teller, who was recruited as a defensive lineman, moved to offensive line to provide much needed depth. He is currently listed as the backup at left tackle behind McLaughlin. </p><p>The injuries this fall have moved up the timetable for some of the Hokies’ talented freshmen and they will be counted upon to help Tech recover from the disappointment of 2012. </p>

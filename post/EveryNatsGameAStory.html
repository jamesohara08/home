<h1>Every Nats Game A Story</h1><b>March 17, 2015</b><p>You might have noticed that today I ran a post under a new title: Every Nats Game’s A Story. This is a new project we at Citizens of Natstown are starting, borrowing from The Classical, to try to capture what it was like to be a Washington Nationals fan over this past decade. There are 162 games in a baseball regular season and each of those carries a unique experience for both the fans in attendance and the fans at home. To many people a random game in August feels like just that, but to you it could’ve been a game to celebrate a birthday, or to catch up with an old friend or so many other things that made it more than just a random game in August. </p><p>We want to capture those moments by having you write about them for Citizens of Natstown.  We’re not looking for a recap or analysis; we want to know how this game affected you and why it is so memorable. You don’t have to write long, flowery prose and you don’t have to be a baseball expert. The only requirement we have is that you watched a Nationals game. If you’ve ever written a tweet about a game, or described to your friends or family a night at Nationals Park you’re ready to contribute. And I, or someone else from our Citizens of Natstown team, will work directly with you to make sure your post looks clean and professional and is something you can proudly share with your friends and family. </p><p>All you have to do is send me an email at jamesoh8 AT vt DOT edu with a short pitch (a paragraph or so) about the game you watched and why it was special to you. Remember there are no limits, it can be literally any Nationals game. It doesn’t even have to be a joyous occasion either, remember we want to capture the entire experience of being a Nats fan and that obviously includes some low points. Then we’ll begin the process of working to share your memory with all of Natstown. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

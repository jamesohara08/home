<h1>Game #93 Recap: Nats Lose to Marlins</h1><b>July 13, 2013</b><div class="entry-content">
<p>The Nationals scored three runs in the first inning for the first time since May 28 and had Stephen Strasburg on the mound but that wasn’t enough to avoid getting blown out by the Miami Marlins, losing 8-3. </p>
<p>Strasburg started the game walking the bases loaded and it only got worse from there. He gave up five runs in the first and then two more in the second inning before exiting. It was easily the worst start of his career statistically, giving up the seven runs in two innings on five hits and four walks, only striking out two. Strasburg finished with 66 pitches, throwing the same amount of strikes as he did balls. </p>
<p>After the three runs in the first on RBIs from Adam LaRoche and Jayson Werth, the Nationals couldn’t get anything going on offense. All of this combined for a forgettable night and a Nats loss, running them to 1-4 since the four game winning streak. </p>
<p>The Nats will look to turn it around tomorrow with Dan Haren making his second start back from the DL facing rookie All-Star Jose Fernandez.  </p>

<h1>Nationals World Cup of Baseball</h1><b>September 03, 2019</b>
<p>So recently the MASN online crew decided to put together an all-time Nationals roster which got me thinking about and putting out my own of on Twitter. Then later, when I was watching the game that night, I was noticing the number of Venezuelans playing key roles for the Nats this year (Asdrubal Cabrera, Gerardo Parra and Anibal Sanchez) and remembering those from previous years like Wilson Ramos and Jose Lobaton and wondered whether you could put an entire all-time Nats roster together of just Venezeulans. Naturally, while working on that I noticed the Dominican Nats and Puerto Rican Nats. So now a week later this has snowballed into a All-Time Nationals World Cup of Baseball with six rosters of Nationals old and new primed for competition. </p><p>The rules are simple here: any Nationals player from 2005-2019 is eligible but only at a position they actually played in with the Nats (with a couple commissioner's exemptions). I tried to pick the best player for each country at each position (this was pretty easy in a lot of cases where there was only one player), but there’s a chance I ignored a tiny upgrade for a player name I recognized more. Finally, I have each player’s Nationals career fWAR and their fWAR in their best season for the Nats to compare the teams with. This is still a Nats-based competition, you can’t get credit for what you did for somebody else.</p><p><strong>Team Venezuela</strong></p><div class="w3-responsive"><table class="w3-table-all"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th><p><strong>Nats WAR</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Best Individual Season</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p>C</p></th><th><p>Jose Lobaton</p></th><th><p>0.6</p></th><th><p>0.7</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>1B</p></th><th><p>Wilson Ramos</p></th><th><p>11.3</p></th><th><p>4.4</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>2B</p></th><th><p>Asdrubal Cabrera</p></th><th><p>1.4</p></th><th><p>1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SS</p></th><th><p>Adrian Sanchez</p></th><th><p>-0.1</p></th><th><p>0.1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>3B</p></th><th><p>Alberto Gonzalez</p></th><th><p>0</p></th><th><p>0.6</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>LF</p></th><th><p>Gerardo Parra</p></th><th><p>0.1</p></th><th><p>0.1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>CF</p></th><th><p>Alex Escobar</p></th><th><p>0.1</p></th><th><p>0.1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RF</p></th><th><p>Endy Chavez</p></th><th><p>0.1</p></th><th><p>0.1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SP</p></th><th><p>Aníbal Sánchez</p></th><th><p>2.2</p></th><th><p>2.2</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Felipe Vazquez</p></th><th><p>1.6</p></th><th><p>0.9</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Henry Rodriguez</p></th><th><p>-0.2</p></th><th><p>0.4</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Yusmeiro Petit</p></th><th><p>-0.1</p></th><th><p>-0.1</p></th></tr><tr><th></th><th><p><strong>Total</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>17</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>10.5</strong></p></th></tr></thead></table></div><p>Since they were the team that started me down this rabbit hole let’s start off with Team Venezuela where I’ve already broken the rules a little bit. Wilson Ramos never played first base for the Nationals. However, Team Venezuela has such a ridiculous glut of catchers that I felt it worthy of finding a way to stick two of them on the team. Seriously, Wilson Ramos, Jose Lobaton, Jesus Flores, Carlos Maldonado, Sandy Leon and Miguel Montero are all Venezuelan catchers who played for the Nats (and all just since 2010!).</p><p>Unfortunately, Ramos is doing pretty much all the heavy lifting for this team accounting for 66 percent of their total WAR. The Parra, Escobar, Chavez outfield is where things really fall apart for Team Venezuela. Chavez only had 12 plate appearances in DC and Escobar is barely better with 99, but they do have a 118 and 147 wRC+ each in that brief time, it’s up to you to decide how much a tiny sample size is worth. Other than Ramos, Cabrera is the only above average hitter with a substantial number of plate appearances. </p><p>Things are a bit better on the pitching side with a solid starting pitcher in Sanchez being paired with a decent reliever in pre-breakout Felipe Vazquez. However, neither is among the best in the tournament and they’re dragged down by two anchors in the other bullpen spots. Overall, that seems to be Team Venezuela’s problem, a couple good players, but none of the best and not enough depth to stand up to the other teams.</p><p><strong>Team Dominican Republic</strong></p><div class="w3-responsive"><table class="w3-table-all"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th><p><strong>Nats WAR</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Best Individual Season</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p>C</p></th><th><p>Pedro Severino</p></th><th><p>-0.2</p></th><th><p>0.6</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>1B</p></th><th><p>Tony Batista</p></th><th><p>-0.3</p></th><th><p>-0.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>2B</p></th><th><p>Anderson Hernandez</p></th><th><p>0.6</p></th><th><p>0.5</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SS</p></th><th><p>Cristian Guzman</p></th><th><p>4.1</p></th><th><p>2.8</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>3B</p></th><th><p>Wilmer Difo</p></th><th><p>1.1</p></th><th><p>0.9</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>LF</p></th><th><p>Alfonso Soriano</p></th><th><p>5.4</p></th><th><p>5.4</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>CF</p></th><th><p>Eury Perez</p></th><th><p>0</p></th><th><p>0.1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RF</p></th><th><p>Jose Guillen</p></th><th><p>3.5</p></th><th><p>3.7</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SP</p></th><th><p>Reynaldo Lopez</p></th><th><p>0.6</p></th><th><p>0.6</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Rafael Soriano</p></th><th><p>1.3</p></th><th><p>0.8</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Fernando Rodney</p></th><th><p>0.4</p></th><th><p>0.4</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Wander Suero</p></th><th><p>1.9</p></th><th><p>1.4</p></th></tr><tr><th></th><th><p><strong>Total</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>18.4</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>16.9</strong></p></th></tr></thead></table></div><p>It should be no surprise that the team that regularly dominates international competitions can even put together a solid roster in our fictional one. While the outfield was a weakness for Team Venezuela it’s a huge strength for Team Dominican Republic with big seasons from two old-school Nationals in Soriano and Guillen. You may be noticing two new Dominican Nationals stars missing from that outfield but rest assured those questions will be answered soon enough. </p><p>Team Dominican Republic looks like an easy favorite against Team Venezuela until you get to the pitching staff. While a bullpen of Soriano (3.15 ERA, 3.38 FIP), Rodney (3.18, 3.66) and Suero (4.11,3.13) is one of the best ones here, it’s questionable if Team Dominican Republic can get to them with the lead. With Reynaldo Lopez as the best Dominican starting pitcher for the Nationals they’ll need their big boppers to put up a lot of runs to stay competitive. In Lopez’s one season with the Nationals he put up a 4.91 ERA while issuing 4.5 BB/9, not a great recipe for success.</p><p>The Dominican Republic offense should be up to the task with five hitters who had a wRC+ over 100 in their best season: Soriano (129 wRC+ in plate appearances), Guillen (114 in 611), Guzman (106 in 612), Hernandez (117 in 91) and Severino (178 in 34). And they’re no slouches on defense with Guillen, Guzman and Difo having above average seasons with their gloves too. Overall, this will be a team hoping to use a solid bullpen to win some close, high scoring games.</p><p><strong>Team Puerto Rico</strong></p><div class="w3-responsive"><table class="w3-table-all"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th><p><strong>Nats WAR</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Best Individual Season</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p>C</p></th><th><p>Ivan Rodriguez</p></th><th><p>1.8</p></th><th><p>1.5</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>1B</p></th><th><p>Wil Cordero</p></th><th><p>-0.7</p></th><th><p>-0.7</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>2B</p></th><th><p>Jose Vidro</p></th><th><p>1.3</p></th><th><p>1.2</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SS</p></th><th><p>Felipe Lopez</p></th><th><p>-0.9</p></th><th><p>0.6</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>3B</p></th><th><p>Alex Cora</p></th><th><p>0</p></th><th><p>0</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>LF</p></th><th><p>Alex Cintron</p></th><th><p>-0.5</p></th><th><p>-0.5</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>CF</p></th><th><p>Luis Matos</p></th><th><p>0</p></th><th><p>0</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RF</p></th><th><p>Jorge Padilla</p></th><th><p>-0.3</p></th><th><p>-0.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SP</p></th><th><p>Luis Atilano</p></th><th><p>0.3</p></th><th><p>0.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Saul Rivera</p></th><th><p>2.1</p></th><th><p>1.2</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Xavier Cedeno</p></th><th><p>0</p></th><th><p>0.1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Jonathan Albaladejo</p></th><th><p>0.3</p></th><th><p>0.3</p></th></tr><tr><th></th><th><p><strong>Total</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>3.4</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>3.7</strong></p></th></tr></thead></table></div><p>I admit Team Puerto Rico is here more for the novelty than as an actually competitive ball club. This team is littered with dregs from the Nationals’ pre-2010 rosters with only Ivan Rodriguez, Alex Cora and Luis Atilano having played for the Nats in this decade. It’s frankly impressive that this team is actually positive in WAR, but that’s likely due to the short stints for many of these players not giving them enough time to rack up the negatives. Still there are seven players in this tournament with a higher best individual season WAR than Team Puerto Rico’s 3.7.</p><p>It should be no surprise that the four players on Team Puerto Rico who played more than 100 games with the Nats are their four decent players: Lopez (325), Rivera (245), Vidro (213) and Rodriguez (155). It’s also not surprising that this team isn’t very good when the second most games played is by a relief pitcher. With a terrible starting pitcher and only one player with a wRC+ above 100 this team will struggle to win a game. There is no truth to the rumors that the Team Puerto Rico officials lobbied heavily for their players’ best non-Nationals seasons to be counted here instead. </p><p><strong>Team USA</strong></p><p>This one took me a minute to figure out because on the one hand, you want the good ol’ US of A to be represented in an international tournament for the sport it invented. However, on the other hand, a team of the best Americans who ever played for the Nats would obviously beat the crap out of everyone else here. So, in the spirit of fairness and fun debates, I’ve limited Team USA eligibility to only players who played a single season for the Nationals. </p><div class="w3-responsive"><table class="w3-table-all"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th><p><strong>Nats WAR</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p>C</p></th><th><p>Spencer Kieboom</p></th><th><p>0.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>1B</p></th><th><p>Adam Lind</p></th><th><p>1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>2B</p></th><th><p>Brian Dozier</p></th><th><p>1.4</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SS</p></th><th><p>Carter Kieboom</p></th><th><p>-0.5</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>3B</p></th><th><p>Jerry Hairston</p></th><th><p>0.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>LF</p></th><th><p>Laynce Nix</p></th><th><p>0.5</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>CF</p></th><th><p>Brad Wilkerson</p></th><th><p>2.4</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RF</p></th><th><p>Daryle Ward</p></th><th><p>0.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SP</p></th><th><p>Patrick Corbin</p></th><th><p>4.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Mark Melancon</p></th><th><p>1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Matt Albers</p></th><th><p>0.9</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Jerry Blevins</p></th><th><p>0.8</p></th></tr><tr><th></th><th><p><strong>Total</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>12.7</strong></p></th></tr></thead></table></div><p>Despite those limitations the Americans put together a solid roster, propped up a bit by a technicality making Patrick Corbin eligible for the roster and providing the best pitcher season for any team in the competition. The rest of Team USA’s pitching staff is similarly solid with excellent closer Mark Melancon and an actually balanced bullpen of righty Albers and lefty Blevins. And yes, Jerry Blevins really did just play for the Nats for one season, I honestly thought he was here longer too. </p><p>However, it is a question of how effective that pitching staff can be with one of the worst defenses in baseball history behind it. Going with bat first guys at pretty much every position leaves them far and away the worst defense here with only Dozier and Wilkerson above average. The other weakness of the team is that the Kieboom brothers aren’t quite ready for primetime here. Spencer Kieboom technically played two seasons by appearing in one game in 2017 but we won’t hold that against him. </p><p>Luckily for Team USA, Corbin, Blevins and Albers all have a K/9 above 9 with the Nats so the defense hopefully won’t be called upon too much. And while a bat-first approach is bad for defense it’s great for offense with five players with a wRC+ over 100 in their best season: Lind (121 wRC+), Wilkerson (103), Ward (144), Hairston (103), and Nix (103), plus Dozier at a 99 wRC+. And unlike Team Dominican Republic, all of those players had at least 120 plate appearances with the Nats. Overall Team USA slots in nicely as a mix between the strengths of Team Venezuela and Team Dominican Republic. </p><p><strong>Team World</strong></p><p>To round out our competition we’ll borrow two team concepts from the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. The first is Team World, a loose analogue to the World Cup of Hockey’s Team Europe. Basically anyone who is not from the USA, Venezuela or Puerto Rico is eligible for this team. Due to some deficiencies in the corner outfield spots they earned a special exemption to grab a pair of Dominicans who couldn’t crack their home country’s lineup.</p><div class="w3-responsive"><table class="w3-table-all"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th><p><strong>Nats WAR</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Best Individual Season</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p>C</p></th><th><p>Yan Gomes</p></th><th><p>0.2</p></th><th><p>0.2</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>1B</p></th><th><p>Matt Stairs</p></th><th><p>-0.6</p></th><th><p>-0.6</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>2B</p></th><th><p>Pete Orr</p></th><th><p>-0.4</p></th><th><p>-0.1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SS</p></th><th><p>Yunel Escobar</p></th><th><p>2.3</p></th><th><p>2.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>3B</p></th><th><p>Vinny Castilla</p></th><th><p>1</p></th><th><p>1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>LF</p></th><th><p>Wily Mo Pena</p></th><th><p>-0.9</p></th><th><p>0.6</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>CF</p></th><th><p>Roger Bernadina</p></th><th><p>1.2</p></th><th><p>1.5</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RF</p></th><th><p>Willy Taveras</p></th><th><p>-0.2</p></th><th><p>-0.2</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SP</p></th><th><p>Livan Hernandez</p></th><th><p>8.3</p></th><th><p>2.6</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Roenis Elias</p></th><th><p>0</p></th><th><p>0</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Luis Ayala</p></th><th><p>0.5</p></th><th><p>0.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Oliver Perez</p></th><th><p>0.5</p></th><th><p>0.4</p></th></tr><tr><th></th><th><p><strong>Total</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>11.9</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>8</strong></p></th></tr></thead></table></div><p>Not quite the disaster that is Team Puerto Rico, but not quite as strong as our other teams with some weaknesses on the right side of the infield and in the bullpen. While we’re grateful that Stairs and Orr hail from the Great White North making it possible to put a team together, that’s about the limit of their usefulness. </p><p>And no, Yunel Escobar didn’t play shortstop for the Nationals but he is one and we need a way to get him and Vinny Castilla on the team so I bent a couple rules, sue me. Speaking of rule bending it’s Wily Mo Pena! I’m so excited we could sneak him onto a team here because of his delightful 1.5 win difference between his Nats career WAR and best season, plus he’d probably love the new baseballs.</p><p>Those three, along with the Original Shark, Bernadina, make up our offensive talent here which is not much to write home about. Really Team World gets screwed here by the format only requiring a single starting pitcher because they’re the only country who could put a starting staff together with some depth with Livo, Esteban Loaiza, Edwin Jackson, Chien-Ming Wang and Cuban Cy Young Yunesky Maya. OK, maybe not that last one. Ultimately this team gets hurt by the Nationals’ shunning of Cuban and Japanese players limiting the potential talent pool.</p><p><strong>Team North America</strong></p><p>Those that followed the World Cup of Hockey probably guessed this was coming after our last team. Team North America was an extremely fun and exciting collection of the best North American players who were 23-and-under, dubbed the Young Gunz. I figured a Nats version would be similarly exciting and interesting so for this team we’re limited by the same rules as the hockey version with an extra twist in that these player’s career Nats WAR and best individual seasons are limited to just their 23-and-under seasons. With these rules in place I figured you can get a balanced team since only the best players get called up so early, but they’re also limited to their first couple seasons.</p><div class="w3-responsive"><table class="w3-table-all"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th><p><strong>Nats WAR</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Best Individual Season</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p>C</p></th><th><p>Raudy Read</p></th><th><p>-0.1</p></th><th><p>-0.1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>1B</p></th><th><p>Chris Marrero</p></th><th><p>-0.7</p></th><th><p>-0.7</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>2B</p></th><th><p>Anthony Rendon</p></th><th><p>1</p></th><th><p>1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SS</p></th><th><p>Trea Turner</p></th><th><p>3.3</p></th><th><p>3.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>3B</p></th><th><p>Ryan Zimmerman</p></th><th><p>11</p></th><th><p>4.5</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>LF</p></th><th><p>Juan Soto</p></th><th><p>7.9</p></th><th><p>4.2</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>CF</p></th><th><p>Victor Robles</p></th><th><p>2.6</p></th><th><p>2.1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RF</p></th><th><p>Bryce Harper</p></th><th><p>22.3</p></th><th><p>9.3</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>SP</p></th><th><p>Stephen Strasburg</p></th><th><p>7.4</p></th><th><p>4</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Drew Storen</p></th><th><p>1.3</p></th><th><p>0.7</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Chad Cordero</p></th><th><p>1</p></th><th><p>1</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>RP</p></th><th><p>Jason Bergmann</p></th><th><p>0.2</p></th><th><p>0.2</p></th></tr><tr><th></th><th><p><strong>Total</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>57.2</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>29.5</strong></p></th></tr></thead></table></div><p>OK, so this team isn’t fair at all and is an absolutely monsterous collection of the best Nationals players in team history who are barely hampered by the 23-and-under seasons rule and also Chris Marrero. Of course the competition was over once I remembered that Bryce Harper’s 2015 MVP year came in his age-22 season. But unlike the 2015 Nationals, Harper isn’t just carrying an otherwise poor team; Zimmerman, Soto and Strasburg all have 4+ WAR seasons as well. Add that to solid seasons from Robles and Turner and you have a talented, well-balanced team. Pretty much only Anthony Rendon in his debut season isn’t performing close to his normal career level in this sample. Overall, Team Young Gunz has nearly as much WAR in their 23-and-under seasons (57.2) as every other team in this competition has in their entire Nats careers (63.4). And that’s with Read and Marrero dragging them down by a win!</p><p>The other thing that’s really cool about this team is that it was the easiest one to put together. There’s no positional or age shenanigans, all of these guys were eligible for the positions they’re playing and only Read didn’t play a significant amount of games. Even the bullpen, which I thought might be difficult to put together as relievers generally come up after 25, has two solid pitchers in Storen and Cordero. We know the Nats have had some special young players come up over the last decade and a half, but it’s cool to see the spread in positions and talents that they represent. It’s not just eight versions of the same guy.</p><p>With a balanced offensive (six players with a wRC+ above 95), defensive (only Harper and Soto are more than 3 runs below average) and pitching attack (all four pitchers have ERAs below 3.10) Team North America is very clearly the best team here. </p><p>However, it’s still an interesting question of who comes in second. By WAR, it’s Team Dominican Republic, but that papers over a weak pitching staff that is easily bested by both Venezuela and Team USA. And while Team World comes up short on overall talent, they’re still good enough to have some competitive games, especially with Livan Hernandez spinning the ball. Overall if these six were to play in a round-robin tournament I’d guess we’d see the standings go like so:</p><ol><li>Team North America</li><li>Team USA</li><li>Team Dominican Republic</li><li>Team Venezuela</li><li>Team World</li><li>Team Puerto Rico</li></ol>

<h1>The Williams Treastie</h1><b>August 04, 2015</b><p><strong>Dave: </strong>There was a time, not too long ago, when I thought hiring Matt Williams was Mike Rizzo's biggest mistake and one he was going to regret for a long time. Since that time my mind has changed as I've watched Matt Williams grow and develop as a manager. This can be explained by two press conferences in 2014. </p><p>The first happened early in the year when after Bryce Harper didn't run a ball out to first base Matt Williams explained to the media that he benched Bryce Harper for a lack of hustle. The media had a field day. Thomas Boswell alone got three columns out of the incident and the buzz was either Matt Williams or Bryce Harper had to go. Later in the season Matt Williams removed Rafael Soriano from the closers role but when the media asked he told them that Soriano was still the closer but had to work some issues out in lower leverage situations. The story died on the vine. That was the change in Matt Williams over the course of 2014. He learned to control the media.</p><p><strong>James: </strong>Yeah and the difference there was night and day. It took about a week for us to finally get the real story out: that upset with the level of play of his team Williams made a team wide proclamation that the next player who didn’t hustle out a ball to first would sit. That player happened to be Harper. But Williams didn’t frame it like a team issue, he framed it as a Bryce issue, and his inexplicable placement of Harper in the lineup didn’t help perceptions. But to this day Rafael Soriano hasn’t been publicly told he’s no longer the Nationals’ closer and Williams was quick to defend Harper angrily after the media ran with his answer to the Junkies about demoting Harper to AAA. </p><p>That’s clear growth as a manager that Williams underwent and it’s hard to argue that it is unlikely that he has grown in other less publicly visible areas as well. There is a debate to be had about whether hiring a rookie manager is a good idea, but it’s important to remember that every manager is a rookie at some point, they don’t just pop out old and wizened, even those that come from the minors don’t have to deal with everything an MLB manager does. And I bet he doesn’t make such general threats again. </p><p><strong>Dave: </strong>2015 has been a much different year for the Washington Nationals. Ryan Zimmerman, Anthony Rendon, Jayson Werth, Stephen Strasburg, Denard Span, and Craig Stammen have all missed significant time and yet the Washington Nationals find themselves in a virtual tie for first place in the NL East. Having that many players miss that much time is a recipe for disaster. Just look at how the 2014 Texas Rangers did when they lost their key pieces. </p><p> </p><p>To pretend to know the dynamics of the clubhouse or if Williams motivated his players to play up to their potential would be foolish. What I do know is that Williams recognized that Danny Espinosa was hot and played him over Dan Uggla and let Espinosa play positions he'd never played before in order to get his bat into the line-up. The same can be said for the decision to play Clint Robinson over Tyler Moore, and it would be bad reasoning to ignore Matt Williams impact on the fact that Clint Robinson has 184 plate appearances against right handed pitchers to just 25 against left handed. </p><p><strong>James: </strong>Your overall point was great and I’ll get more on that in a second, but I would to focus on one kernel you have there. That we can’t possibly know what the dynamics of the clubhouse are, what his relationship with the players is like, or a host of other private information that doesn’t leak out. This is what makes me loathe to move beyond the murky grey middle when rating managers. Even those who are thought of as good managers now like Joe Maddon, Bruce Bochy and Buck Showalter have their critics and detractors. There’s so much behind the scenes we just can’t know and so little data or control to measure what we can see, that public declarations of the best or worst managers are fairly meaningless. We can only see 30 shades of gray.</p><p>But back to your point on how Williams has managed the bench this season, I’ve often quipped that this year is like putting the 2012 Nats bench with the 2013 Nats bullpen, the bench has been that good. And while a lot of credit is due to Espinosa, Robinson, Lobaton and Taylor for performing at a high level and an undetermined amount of credit due to lady luck, Williams should get his due too. </p><p>A lot of people likely forget that Uggla started the first four games of the season at second against RHP, before Espinosa started against a LHP. Already a great decision due to Espinosa’s ability to mash from the right side. They traded starts for a few games before Espinosa took over for good 14 games into the season. That’s a fast trigger on the platoon and Espinosa has rewarded his faith greatly. I don’t have much to add on Robinson, I think that ratio speaks for itself, but I will point out that Williams did the same thing to bring Espinosa along in 2014, dropping his percentage of plate appearances to 68.4 percent from 77.8 percent the year before. Hey look! Something Matt Williams does well! </p><p><strong>Dave: </strong>But the biggest complaint about Matt Williams in 2015 has little to do with the line-up and a lot to do with bullpen management. It should be said more that before the season even started he lost Tyler Clippard, Rafael Soriano, Jerry Blevins, and then Craig Stammen a couple games in from his bullpen. Williams lost 262 1/3 innings from veteran relievers before the first pitch of the 2015 season was thrown and Mike Rizzo had decided to fill the majority of those innings internally. Most of Williams’ bullpen management in 2015 has been playing match-ups, trying to find out if a rookie has it and praying he can get the ball to Drew Storen. </p><p>Rizzo recently traded for Jonathan Papelbon and this fixed some of the Nationals bullpen issues. It gave them the second back of the bullpen arm that Blake Treinen and Aaron Barrett failed to develop into but it didn't fully fix the Nationals bullpen and those issues became evident over the weekend. On Friday night the Washington Nationals found themselves in a jam when Gio Gonzalez failed to get out of the fifth inning. Tanner Roark, Aaron Barrett, and Felipe Rivero all pitched multiple innings with Drew Storen unavailable due to back-to-back days of work and Casey Janssen out with a neck issue. The three younger members of the Nats bullpen did an admirable job, but Rivero eventually faltered and the Nats lost in extra innings. Now the question becomes why did Rivero pitch the 12th and the answer might be as simple as Williams figured he'd burned three relievers, wasn't going to use Papelbon in a non-save and Thornton is 38 years old and is an every other day pitcher at this point in his career. Thus it was up to Rivero to sink or swim and unfortunately for the Nats he sank. </p><p><strong>James: </strong>Right and it shows that there is some explanation. Even if I disagree with not using Papelbon in the tie game first, that’s unfortunately something nearly every manager does and hopefully one day Williams will see the light there. Otherwise this is an example of the issues they’ve had all year, two of their best relievers are old and breaking down in Janssen and Thornton. They can’t handle a heavy workload. Meaning that in those few times Storen isn’t available the bullpen can seriously shorten. I hated it at the time and I still hate it now, but it’s not unexplainable. </p><p><strong>Dave: </strong>This brings us to Saturday night where the Nationals once again found themselves in a close game entering the late innings. Joe Ross was stellar through six innings and had a low pitch count to start the seventh. He ended up surrendering the tying run causing Williams to summon Janssen to finish off the inning. With Curtis Granderson and Lucas Duda both due up in the eighth Williams went with his top lefty out of the pen, Matt Thornton. Thornton surrendered a double to Granderson and Williams elected to walk right handed hitting Yoenis Cespedes to face Duda who has just a .666 career OPS against left handed pitchers. Duda doubled and the move didn't work out which left fans questioning why Drew Storen wasn't in the game, and here is a fundamental question. Should bullpen management be a game of diminishing or improving returns? </p><p>If Storen had pitched the eighth and escaped unharmed then Thornton probably pitches the ninth unless you believe Drew Storen's presence inspires the offense to score causing Matt Williams to summon Papelbon for the save. </p><p><strong>James: </strong>Right, with the top lefty hitters coming in, it made sense to go to your best lefty to counter them and leave Storen for the ninth. I’d contend that it makes even more sense to just run Storen in the eighth and Papelbon in the ninth, but it’s hard to kill a guy over something nearly every other manager does. With the lefty-lefty matchups Williams put his pitcher in a position to succeed and he didn’t. That can’t be pinned on the manager. </p><p>The only time I’ve ever seen a Williams bullpen decision that was completely unexplainable was in Game 4 of the playoffs. That’s a do or die game, who cares if a guy is tired, the season is over if you don’t win. To go to bottom tier relievers Barrett and then Soriano over Clippard, Storen and Strasburg was inexcusable. Nothing can ever explain that decision. </p><p>But the playoffs were the driving agent, the short haul was way more important than the long. That simply can’t be said about the regular season, you’re in it for the long run. Williams learned that early in his career when the relievers begged him in May to stop getting them up so many times without entering the game. And he did! And I bet that’s where the comfort with defined roles over matchups comes from. It’s much easier to know the eighth inning is coming than two lefties three batters away with two outs. Save the bullets for the game and keep the guys happy. </p><p>Not to say Williams hasn’t played matchups extensively this season, because he has. Barret has faced 69 percent RHBs this season, Janssen 61 percent. Meanwhile Thornton has faced 51 percent LHBs. Just like with Espinosa and Robinson, Williams has tried to keep guys in situations where they can succeed. As a whole I think he has done a good job to get the most out his guys without running them into the ground. </p><p><strong>Dave: </strong>Like you were saying earlier, it is my contention that Matt Williams is not much different than the majority of major league managers. He isn't in the same class as Bruce Bochy or Buck Showalter, but that doesn’t make him bad. Matt Williams in 2015 has dealt with an absurd number of injuries and somehow the Nationals find themselves fighting for a third division title in four seasons. Matt Williams in-game strategy may not be ideal but outside of Game 4 of the 2014 NLDS it is logical and more importantly than in-game strategy he can manage people. After the hiccup of the Harper benching in 2014 Matt Williams has held the clubhouse together and his players don't get too high after a win or too low after a loss. Williams rarely overreacts to small samples and stays out of the way of his players letting their talent determine the outcome on the field which is what anyone should want from a major league manager.   </p><p><strong>James: </strong>I think as we wrap up here that neither of us love Matt Williams as manager and that we both disagree with some of his in-game decisions. But a manager’s value is in the whole package, not just the highly charged easy to evaluate bullpen and lineup decisions. And even then I think Williams gets it right most of the time. Do you know which team is last in the NL in non-pitcher sac bunts over the last two seasons? That’s right, Matt Williams’ Nationals. </p><p>When push comes to shove, I think Williams’ relative strengths and weaknesses balance out. And as we’ve noted he’s shown a clear willingness to learn on the job and improve on those weaknesses. Is he really NL Manager of the Year-caliber? I don’t think so. But that doesn’t mean the opposite is true either. Nats fans will have to be content in that murky gray zone and hope that if they make the playoffs again this year, Williams can show that he learned from his experience last year. And remember, this isn’t life or death, it’s baseball. </p>

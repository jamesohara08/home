<h1>Sports Roundup June 30</h1><b>June 30, 2011</b><p>Yesterday’s Big Story – 12<sup>th</sup> seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga a relative unknown from France upset Roger Federer at Wimbledon in 5 sets 3-6, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.  An incredible upset considering that Federer had come into the match 178-0 when leading after two sets, as he was before Tsonga rallied back to win the match.  Tsonga will advance to the semifinals where he will meet possibly an even tougher opponent in 2<sup>nd</sup> seeded Novak Djokovic.</p><p>Yesterday’s Star- Jordan Zimmermann, pitcher, Washington Nationals:  Jordan pitched  a sterling 8 innings giving up only one unearned run for his 11<sup>th</sup> straight quality start but still managed to earn the loss.  During this streak he has lowered his ERA from 4.29 to 2.63 ranking him 5<sup>th</sup> among National League starters.  His full line for the night was:  8 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 4 K, on 93 total pitches.</p><p>Stat of the Day- Inspired by the Mets offensive downpour in Detroit where they scored 16 runs without a single home run to blowout the Tigers for the second straight game by a score of 16-9.  There have been 20 major league games since 1990 in which a team has scored 16 runs without a HR. Most recently: 8/30/10 HOU vs. St. Louis</p><p>Yesterday in Washington – Despite the aforementioned gem of a game pitched by Jordan Zimmermann the Nationals were on the wrong end of a sweep, losing to the Angels 1-0.  The loss dropped them back under .500 with a mark of 40-41.  The Nats now head home to D.C. to begin an eleven game homestand, where they boast a winning percentage of .629.</p><p>Today In Washington – Absolutely nothing as the Nationals have an off day along with every other sport. </p>

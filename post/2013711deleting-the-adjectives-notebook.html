<h1>Deleting the Adjectives: Notebook</h1><b>July 11, 2013</b><div class="entry-content">
<p class="MsoNormal">While researching for today’s column I found a lot of stats<br/>
or small nuggets of information I found interesting, but none that on their own<br/>
could be a column. After much deliberation I decided to use that to my<br/>
advantage by creating a sort of notebook column this week where I will share<br/>
with you everything I found that were interesting or amusing. So here we go. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals rank 23rd in Major League Baseball in total<br/>
wins above replacement using the superior Fangraphs version. Total wins above<br/>
replacement is the sum of the team’s total position player WAR and total<br/>
pitcher WAR. The Nats ranked ahead of the White Sox, Mariners, Twins, Brewers,<br/>
Padres, Marlins and Astros. The Padres and Astros were the only teams to have a<br/>
part of their team perform below replacement level as a whole. The Padres<br/>
position players have amassed -1.7 WAR, while the Astros pitchers clocked in at<br/>
-.6 WAR. The best team in baseball in terms of total WAR is the Detroit Tigers<br/>
at 33.6 wins above replacement. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the return of Wilson Ramos and Bryce Harper from injuries<br/>
the Nationals finally have their full starting eight together, with an Anthony<br/>
Rendon subbed in for a Danny Espinosa. With a full complement of hitters the<br/>
Nationals now have six players entering last night’s game with a wOBA above .340,<br/>
which is above average. Only Adam LaRoche at .336 and Denard Span at .300 did<br/>
not make the cut. Don’t be surprised to see more and more consistent scoring<br/>
from here on out. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals are in the bottom half of the league when it<br/>
comes to batting average on balls in play at .285, coming in at 24th in Major<br/>
League Baseball. That likely has something to do with their 19.4% line drive<br/>
rate, which ranks 27th in all of baseball. The Nats aren’t having much luck<br/>
with the long ball either, with a 10.3% home run to fly ball ratio, good for 20th<br/>
in the Majors. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That isn’t for lack of line drive pitches, as the Nationals<br/>
rank second in baseball in percentage of fastballs seen at 60.4% of all pitches<br/>
seen. Only the Los Angeles Dodgers, at 61.5%, see more fastballs as a team. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals are one of the better teams at not swinging at<br/>
pitches out of the zone, ranking 11th in the Majors by swinging at only 29.8%<br/>
of the pitches they see out of the zone. That might be because the Nationals<br/>
don’t like to swing the bat in general, as they also have one of the lowest<br/>
swing rates at pitches inside the zone, 64.2% (7th in MLB), and overall, 45.6%<br/>
(9th in MLB). The lack of swinging is not helping the team’s walk rate though,<br/>
as they rank a middling 19th in baseball at 7.5%.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps the lack of swinging is why the Nationals see the<br/>
second highest percentage of first pitch strikes in Major League Baseball at<br/>
62%. Only the Brewers see more with 63.9% of their first pitches being called<br/>
strikes. That is a lot of plate appearances the Nationals are falling behind in<br/>
right out of the gate. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let’s get back to some nice notes. The Nationals are one of<br/>
only three teams with two starters who have thrown more than 100 innings and<br/>
have an ERA of below 3.00, as Jordan Zimmermann (2.57 ERA) and Stephen Strasburg<br/>
(2.45 ERA) do. The other two teams are the Dodgers with Clayton Kershaw (1.89<br/>
ERA) and Hyun-Jin Ryu (2.82 ERA) and the Seattle Mariners with Felix Hernandez<br/>
(2.69 ERA) and Hisashi Iwakuma (2.97). Of those teams, the Nationals are the<br/>
only one to have another starter below a 4.00 ERA, with Gio Gonzalez and his<br/>
3.03 ERA. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Despite Dan Haren and his 2.00 HR/9, Nationals pitchers are fifth<br/>
best in Major League Baseball in home run to fly ball ratio, with just 9.6% of<br/>
their fly balls given up going over the fence. Reducing the number of home runs<br/>
allowed is one way to keep run totals low. </p>
<p>Finally, 2013 All-Star Game Final Vote candidate<br/>
Ian Desmond is now third in Major League Baseball in WAR at 3.2 wins above<br/>
replacement, moving ahead of Jean Segura. If you would like to read more about<br/>
how Desmond has become the player he is read my post from earlier this week.</p>

<h1>ACC Roundup 12</h1><b>November 20, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>After this past weekend’s games we are right on track for either a five way tie in the ACC Coastal Division or the Duke Blue Devils in the ACC Championship Game. It remains to be seen which one of these scenarios is more ludicrous. This is your ACC Roundup. </p><p>Florida State 59 – Syracuse 3: Meanwhile in the Atlantic Division the Seminoles continued the systemic destruction of their opponents. The victory made the Seminoles the first team to score at least 59 points and allow at most three points in consecutive games since they did it in 1988. At this point Jameis Winston might as well throw passes backwards to give the other team a fighting chance. </p><p>Clemson 55 – Georgia Tech 31: The Yellow Jackets 2011 upset of a similar Tigers team and recent romps over Syracuse, Virginia and Pittsburgh had some thinking upset. The Tigers put those thoughts to rest quickly though, jumping out to a 20-0 lead and cruising the rest of the way. However, the biggest revelation from the game was that the Yellow Jackets have a running back named Robert Godhigh, which is one of the better college athlete names this side of God Shammgod. </p><p>Boston College 38 – NC State 21: With Virginia on a bye week, the Wolfpack seized the opportunity and made a strong claim for the worst team in the ACC. Meanwhile, Eagles running back Andre Williams broke his own school record for single game rushing yards while setting the season record, rushing for 339 yards. Williams now leads the nation in rushing by 371 yards and could be the first 2000 yard rusher since 2008. In other words, he’s Chase Rettig’s dream come true. </p><p>North Carolina 34 – Pittsburgh 27: Ryan Switzer returned two punts for Tar Heel touchdowns, while Panthers quarterback Tom Savage took yet another beating. Savage managed to throw for 313 yards and two touchdowns while being sacked seven times. The Tar Heels took the victory though and kept their hopes alive to order ACC co-champions rings for the second year in a row. Which is a sentence sad enough on its own that I have nothing to add.</p><p>Duke 48 – Miami 30: This game was close until the fourth quarter when the Blue Devils went on a 17-0 run to bury the Hurricanes and put them in prime position to go to the ACC Championship Game. You might joke that that sentence sounds like it applies to basketball more than football, but you would be wrong because college basketball is played in halves not quarters. You must be kind of stupid. </p><p>That’s it for ACC action this week. With Duke playing Wake Forest and Miami facing Virginia it seems like the Coastal Division will be free of drama for the weekend, but then again this is the ACC where drama comes both when you least and most suspect it. And on that note, #goacc. </p>

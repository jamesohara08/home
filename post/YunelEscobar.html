<h1>Yunel Escobar</h1><b>January 31, 2015</b><p>Yunel Escobar is a player new to the Nationals, but he is not a player new to change or trouble. In just under five seasons Escobar has been a member of six organizations including the Nats. Seemingly his talent on the field, a career 101 wRC+ and 51.5 runs saved defensively at a premium position, has been outweighed by his troubles off of it. His most notable off-field issue came in September 2012, when he was suspended for three games for wearing eye black that had a Spanish homophobic slur written on it. </p><p>This isn’t the first player the Nationals have acquired who has had trouble off the field, but they haven’t made a habit of it in reason seasons. Rafael Soriano, Bryce Harper and Jayson Werth have all developed reputations to some degree of being a jerk, but nothing to the degree of Escobar. However, during his recent time with the Rays the stories about Escobar’s personality quieted down and while he likely is not a model citizen, there is still a possibility that he can fit in to the Nationals clubhouse dynamics. </p><p>On the field he should be a valued contributor, taking over the starting second base job in 2015 and possibly shifting over to shortstop for a potentially departing Ian Desmond in 2016. And he comes at a dirt cheap price, signed to a two year contract worth just $12 million and an option for a third year at $7 million. With the price for a win above replacement valued at around $6-7 million, it’s hard to see Escobar not being worth it. </p><p>At the plate Escobar brings a different skillset than the typical Nats batter. For his career he has a healthy walk rate, at 8.9 percent, and a low strikeout rate, at 11.3 percent. Looking further Escobar doesn’t chase pitches, swinging at 22.6 percent of pitches outside of the strike zone, while making contact at a high rate, 85.2 percent. That does make his overall results dependent on his batting average on balls in play as seen in the table below. </p><div class="w3-responsive"><table class="w3-table-all"><tr><td></td><td><p>    BABIP</p></td><td><p>    wRC+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2007</p></td><td><p>0.364</p></td><td><p>121</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2008</p></td><td><p>0.311</p></td><td><p>106</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2009</p></td><td><p>0.317</p></td><td><p>120</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2010</p></td><td><p>0.282</p></td><td><p>83</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p>0.316</p></td><td><p>116</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>0.273</p></td><td><p>73</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>0.281</p></td><td><p>100</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2014</p></td><td><p>0.282</p></td><td><p>95</p></td></tr></div></table><p>With the Nats it is more likely he’ll put up a wRC+ closer to 95 than to 121, Steamer projects him for a 98 wRC+ in 2015, but at second base that’s still above average. </p><p>Defensively, there are some bigger questions. Up until last season Escobar had great defensive numbers at shortstop, averaging 10.2 defensive runs above average in his six seasons as a starter according to FanGraphs. And then last season his numbers fell off a cliff as he was worth -11.0 defensive runs above average, second worst among all shortstops in MLB. It’s unlikely that Escobar really experienced such a sharp decline in defensive skill, but at 32 it is likely that he has experienced some decline. With a large part of his value coming from his glove, the Nats will have to hope that his 2014 was an abnormality. </p><p>Overall if Escobar can keep his off the field issues behind him and can rebound on the defensive end he should be a valuable part of the Nats for the next two or three years. </p>

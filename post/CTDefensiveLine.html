<h1>CT Defensive Line</h1><b>September 11, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>When thinking about the Virginia Tech Hokies defensive line, the first thing that comes to mind is defensive end James Gayle. </p><p>And for good reason, Gayle is a two-time second-team All-ACC selection and has a good chance at being drafted. After the Hokies season opener against Alabama, Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban specifically signaled out Gayle for praise. </p><p>“Their 99 gave us a lot of problems in pass protection,” Saban said.</p><p>But the story of the Tech defensive line does not end with Gayle. Defensive line is the Hokies deepest position and it is one of the deepest defensive lines in the nation. </p><p>Gayle’s fellow starters: defensive tackles Luther Maddy and Derrick Hopkins and defensive end JR Collins, are all talented players in their own right. </p><p>Defensive line is somewhat unique among position groups as backups receive a significant amount of guaranteed playing time. With the proliferation of up-tempo spread offenses, like the one run by East Carolina, this is truer than ever. </p><p>The Hokies are not lacking in that department either.  Dadi Nicolas, Woody Barron, Nigel Williams, Tyrel Wilson and the newly returned Corey Marshall all provide solid production when one of the starters needs a rest.</p><p>The return of Marshall provides a boost to a defensive line that was already firing on all cylinders.</p><p>“Having him back on the team means a lot. We’ll be able to continue to grow with him,” said defensive end James Gayle. </p><p>With Wilson dealing with a knee injury that kept him out of the Western Carolina game, Marshall’s ability to play both tackle and end will help the Hokies. </p><p>In their first two games of the season the Hokies have had 10 defensive lineman record a tackle for a loss. Four defensive linemen have recorded a sack: Dadi Nicolas, J.R. Collins, Luther Maddy and Nigel Williams. </p><p>That mix of starters and backups shows how much talent is spread throughout the group. The defensive line is deep enough to help out other positions with their depth issues as well. </p><p>Redshirt junior Zack McCray spent his first three seasons with the Hokies on the defensive line before moving to tight end late in the 2012 season. </p><p>After injuries and attrition in the fall, freshman Wyatt Teller volunteered to move to offensive tackle. Teller was recruited as a defensive lineman, but is now the backup to fellow freshman Jonathan McLaughlin at left tackle. </p><p>On Wednesday Alston Smith, son of Hokies and NFL great Bruce Smith, followed Teller and switched to offensive guard. </p><p>The Hokies have been able to take advantage of a position of strength to help the team. </p><p>This week the entire defensive line will face a significant challenge in East Carolina’s up-tempo, quick-strike attack. </p><p>“We really got our work cut out for us this week, without question. You talking about an offense that’s scoring,” said head coach Frank Beamer, “They’re a good team, explosive team. Really tough on defense, good athletes over there.”</p><p>That does not mean they will be unprepared for the Pirates’ brand of football.</p><p>It’s definitely frustrating, but hopefully we’ll be able to get them behind the sticks. Where they’ll have to take more time in the pocket,” Gayle said, “If they [Hokies defensive linemen] can get their hands up, or just get in the quarterback’s face that will be able to disrupt the tempo.”</p><p>The Hokies will be counting on their entire two-deep to get the job done and they’re up to the task. After the Western Carolina game Derrick Hopkins stated their mentality for the season. </p><p>“It doesn’t matter how good one team was or how bad one team was. We go out there and play Hokie football each day, each game,” Hopkins said. </p>

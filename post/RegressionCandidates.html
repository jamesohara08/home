<h1>Regression Candidates</h1><b>July 04, 2013</b><p>Before the start of the 2013 season there were three Nationals players who were commonly thought to be regression candidates Gio Gonzalez, Adam LaRoche and Ian Desmond. All three had excellent years in 2012 earning many accolades for their respective efforts, but all three had put up numbers above their career averages.</p><p>For Gonzalez and LaRoche it was easy to see that their numbers would retreat a bit. Neither demonstrated any new skills, they merely did what they always did just slightly better. Lo and behold both are still doing well in 2013, but they are not replicating the success in 2013.</p><p>In Desmondâ€™s case things were a bit trickier.

Known for his plus arm and range Desmond was known for making mistakes in the field and for trying to make a play out of nothing. In 2010 he had a disastrous 34 errors, but in 2012 he had managed to cut it down to an average 15.

However, with his gains coming so quickly it begged the question of exactly what he would be capable of in 2013. Some said the power was a fluke and he would come down closer to 15 a season, while others thought t</p>

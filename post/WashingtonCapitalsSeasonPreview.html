<h1>Washington Capitals Season Preview</h1><b>May 23, 2012</b><p>After a long but ultimately disappointing playoff run the Washington Capitals are gearing up for another season.  While this season was certainly disappointing considering the Cup or Bust mentality to start the season, a couple of great pieces for the future were identified as the Caps continue to try and find the winning combination.  As they head into the free agent season the Caps have a few decisions to make about their own players before they go out and try and find that second line center theyâ€™ve needed the last four years.  So here is our guide on the ten restricted and unrestricted free agents who played for the Caps last season, sorted by keepers, maybes, and soon to be ex-Caps.</p><p><strong>Keepers: </strong></p><p>Jay Beagle </p><p>John Carlson</p><p>Dennis Wideman</p><p><strong>Maybes:</strong></p><p>Mike Green</p><p>Mathieu Perreault</p><p>Keith Aucoin</p><p><strong>Ex-Caps:</strong></p><p>Jeff Halpern</p><p>Mike Knuble</p><p>Alex Semin</p><p>Tomas Vokun</p>

<h1>ACC Roundup 13</h1><b>December 04, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>As you know the ACC Roundup has been a huge fan of the five-way tie in the ACC Coastal. Alas, we fell one game short, with Duke managing to put away North Carolina to take the title. And yes that is to say that Duke winning an ACC division is actually a disappointment in terms of the absurd. This is your ACC Roundup. </p><p>Duke 27 – North Carolina 25: With the win the Blue Devils secured their first 10-win season in school history, first ACC Championship Game appearance and are also bowl-eligible in consecutive seasons for the first time. Virginia Tech fans meanwhile turned their noses up at eight straight 10-win seasons, five ACC Championship Game appearances and 21 consecutive bowl appearances. Perspective is a scary thing. </p><p>Miami 41 – Pittsburgh 31: In a battle of talented freshman wide receivers the Hurricanes’ Stacy Coley outperformed the Panthers’ Tyler Boyd, scoring three touchdowns to lead the way for the Hurricanes. With the loss the Panthers went 6-6 for the third straight season. The good news though is that with the move to the ACC the Panthers will avoid going to the BBVA Compass Bowl for the fourth straight year. It will be a sad day in Birmingham, Alabama though. </p><p>Florida State 37 – Florida 7: The Seminoles started slow, scoring just three points in the first quarter. Then Seminoles receiver Kelvin Benjamin decided he had enough and ran over the entire Gators secondary to score his first of three touchdowns and the rout was on. The Seminoles victory kept the ACC from being swept in their four rivalry games against the SEC, which sure was swell of them. </p><p>Vanderbilt 23 – Wake Forest 21: The Demon Deacons avoided being railroaded (heh) by the Commodores which is about all we can ask from them. Quarterback Tanner Price completed 16 of 32 passes for 155 yards, no touchdowns and an interception in his final game for the Demon Deacons, which is about right.</p><p>Maryland 41 – North Carolina State 21: The Terrapins finished their time in the ACC by destroying a terrible Wolfpack team. They will probably be missed by someone I guess. What’s really sad is that we never got to see the Wolfpack play against Virginia this season. Did I say sad? Sorry I meant relieving. </p><p>Georgia 41 – Georgia Tech 34: The Bulldogs were without starting quarterback Aaron Murray, giving the Yellow Jackets an excellent opportunity to break their five game winning streak in the series. The Yellow Jackets were up 20-0 at one point in this game and were leading by three with the ball and just four minutes to go in the game. Then quarterback Vad Lee was taken over by the spirit of Reggie Ball and threw the ball right to a Bulldogs defender, setting up the tying field goal and eventual Tech loss. </p><p>Syracuse 34 – Boston College 31: The good: With the victory the Orange became the ACC’s eleventh bowl eligible team.  The bad: the Eagles sensational running back and Heisman dark horse Andre Williams, the first college football player to rush for over 2,000 yards since 2008, was injured in the third quarter. Without Williams, quarterback Chase Rettig took over the running game, rushing four times for 85 yards and a touchdown, leaving some wondering if he missed his true calling. </p><p>South Carolina 31 – Clemson 17: Tajh Boyd struggled again struggled against the Gamecocks, tossing two interceptions while being sacked five times. The worst moment of the game for Boyd came when he was stripped while trying to lead the Tigers to the game-tying score. The Gamecocks scored moments later to seal the game. Despite all the accolades, Boyd finished his career 0-4 against the Tigers main rival, a thorn that will likely stick in his side for years to come.</p><p>That’s it for the ACC Roundup this year. Thanks for a fun season and, remember, #goacc. </p>

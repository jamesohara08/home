<h1>CT VT Offensive Line</h1><b>February 05, 2014 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>The Virginia Tech football team’s most troubled unit got a big boost on Wednesday as the Hokies netted four offensive line recruits as part of their 2014 recruiting class. </p><p>Tech’s offensive line has been a sore spot in recent years as players shuffle from position-to-position while the results on the field continue to be lackluster. </p><p>In 2013 the Hokies ranked 109th in the nation in rushing yards, averaging just 119.8 yards per game. The line wasn’t much better when Tech decided to pass as they allowed 32 sacks, 28th most in the country. </p><p>While not all of the blame falls on the offensive line, they take the brunt of the blame for the Hokies offensive struggles in recent seasons. It’s no secret Frank Beamer wants to run a smashmouth, clock-controlling style of offense that relies heavily on the run, but that can’t be accomplished without a good offensive line. </p><p>Enter the newest recruits: Billy Ray Mitchell (Paramus, N.J.), Colt Pettit (Hamler, Ohio), Eric Gallo (Southampton, Pa.) and Tyrell Smith (Ramsey, N.J.). Dubbed the “Fab Four” by fans, all four recruits were rated three stars by 247 Sports before signing their national letters of intent. </p><p>This is the first time Tech has had four offensive line recruits in one class since 2010 when Mark Shuman, Matt Arkema, Caleb Farris and Laurence Gibson committed to the Hokies. This is also the first time Tech has had multiple out-of-state offensive line recruits since 2008 with Nick Becton and Michael Via.</p><p>“We felt right from the very beginning, it was going to be important how we recruited up front,” said Tech recruiting coordinator Bryan Stinespring on Hokie Sports’ signing day special.</p><p>The recruitment process wasn’t easy, as all four commits’ primary recruiter was former offensive line coach Jeff Grimes, who left in mid-January to take the same position at Louisiana State University. Some quick work by offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler and the Hokies coaching staff was able to keep the group together. </p><p>“After about (three) years of the recruiting process, it's finally over. Couldn't be more (happy) to be a Hokie,” said Pettit via Twitter after making his commitment official. </p><p>When asked why he chose to attend Virginia Tech, Mitchell cited a former Tech quarterback as his inspiration.</p><p>“I used to watch them on TV growing up and Tyrod Taylor was one of my favorite players in college growing up,” Mitchell told Hokie Sports. </p><p>Stinespring agreed that Mitchell was born to be a Hokie.</p><p>&quot;With a name like Billy Ray, come on, that's Virginia Tech,&quot; Stinespring said. </p><p>With the offensive line returning four starters from last season, it is unlikely that any of the four make an immediate impact on the Hokies. However, they will provide much-needed depth to a unit that had to bring in converted defensive lineman to shore up its ranks last season. </p><p>According to beamerball.com, Mitchell, 6 feet 4 inches, 285 pounds, Pettit, 6 feet 4 inches, 250 pounds and Gallo, 6 feet 2 inches, 275 pounds, will start off their Tech careers at guard. While Smith, 6 feet 4 inches, 259 pounds, will begin at tackle. </p><p>“We just have to get them Gentry-cised (referring to strength coach Mike Gentry). Most of these guys they have that growth potential, they have that ability,” Stinespring said.</p><p>While the “Fab Four” likely won’t make an immediate impact on the Hokies, they figure to be the backbone of future Tech offensive lines.</p>

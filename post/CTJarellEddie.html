<h1>CT Jarell Eddie</h1><b>November 06, 2012 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>As a junior power forward Jarell Eddie is just one of three upperclassmen on the Virginia Tech Hokies men’s basketball team this season.  At just 6’7” and 218 pounds Eddie is a bit undersized for a power forward, and because of this he moves around to other positions as well.</p><p>Eddie was a four-star recruit from Charlotte, North Carolina brought in by former head coach Seth Greenberg in 2010 and has seen his role expand over the past two seasons.  </p><p>In his freshmen year Eddie played in 27 games averaging just 2.9 points and 2.2 rebounds per game. Playing in a limited role from the bench, he showed in flashes the potential that led him to being a highly rated recruit. </p><p>In his sophomore turn Eddie showed more maturity as well as gaining significantly more playing time.  He played in all 33 games averaging 27.3 minutes per game while demonstrating a deft shooting touch from behind the 3-point line, making 44.3% of his shots from beyond the arc.  </p><p>Eddie was the third leading scorer on the team with 9.1 points per game.  However, he struggled to score points consistently and was not much of a factor on the boards. </p><p>This season Eddie will be expected to take another step forward and bring experience to a fairly raw frontcourt.  Eddie will be relied upon to be a more consistent scoring presence as well, while playing more minutes than he has previously. </p><p>In new head coach James Johnson’s faster paced offense Eddie’s athleticism should shine and he should find plenty of open opportunities from beyond the arc.   If Eddie can continue his best in the ACC three -point percentage and can hold up in an increased role, the Hokies will have an ideal sidekick to pair with star guard Erick Green.</p>

<h1>Game #22 Recap: O’Hara Curse Lifted, Nats Win</h1><b>April 26, 2013</b><div class="entry-content">
<p class="MsoNormal">For the first time this season the Nationals won a game when<br/>
I was recapping them. The Nats came into the game against the Cincinnati Reds under<br/>
.500 for the first time since 2011, struggling to find answers as to why they<br/>
were having so much trouble. A shake-up in the lineup and a gem by Gio<br/>
Gonzalez was just what they needed and the Nationals got some payback winning 8-1.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Gonzalez was masterful, getting out the first eleven batters<br/>
he faced. The only Reds hit all day was a home run by Joey Votto. After that,<br/>
Gonzalez shut the Reds down, allowing only two more base runners, both on<br/>
walks, for the rest of his sterling eight innings. Gonzalez finished the game<br/>
on 112 pitches, striking out seven.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the Nationals struggling mightily to score runs in<br/>
their last two series against the New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals, Davey<br/>
Johnson decided it was time for a change. Jayson Werth moved down the lineup<br/>
to bat clean-up, while Steve Lombardozzi got the start at third, batting<br/>
second.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The moved paid off in a big way, with the 3-7 hitters going<br/>
7-19 with four extra base hits and five RBIs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Danny Espinosa busted out of his slump in a big way driving in<br/>
the game’s first run by knocking in Ian Desmond with a double. He continued his<br/>
tear in the third inning with a two-run home run, his second on the year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That home run capped off a four run inning that extended the<br/>
Nationals lead to 6-0. Bryce Harper started it off with a solo home run, his<br/>
eighth. In between, Ian Desmond picked up an RBI on a groundout, scoring Jayson<br/>
Werth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Opposing starter Bronson Arroyo left the game after the<br/>
sixth inning after giving up six runs, five earned, on nine hits, two<br/>
strikeouts and a walk. Arroyo, who has stumped the Nationals in the past,<br/>
failed to deceive any of the Nationals hitters.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nats tacked on two more runs in the eighth inning. After<br/>
Roger “the Shark” Bernadina got his first hit of the season, Denard Span drove<br/>
him and Kurt Suzuki in on his first triple of the year. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rafael Soriano made his first appearance since last<br/>
Saturday, ending the game with little drama.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals look to continue their winning ways tomorrow<br/>
with Jordan Zimmermann matching up against Homer Bailey. </p>

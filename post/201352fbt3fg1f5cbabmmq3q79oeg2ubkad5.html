<h1>Game #29 Recap: Haren Shines</h1><b>May 3, 2013</b><div class="entry-content">
<p>The Nationals came into the final game of the four game series with the Braves looking for a split and on the back of an excellent start by Dan Haren they got it, winning 3-1. </p>
<p>Haren got through the first eight batters he faced in order on only 21 pitches, before allowing a walk to opposing pitcher Kris Medlen. After that blip he continued to mow down Braves hitters, allowing only one base runner until the seventh inning.</p>
<p>The Nationals offense got to Medlen early in the game, scoring all three of their runs in the first two innings. </p>
<p>In the first, Denard Span doubled to right field and then took third on a wild pitch. With single from Steve Lombardozzi the Nationals were on the board.</p>
<p>Span was a part of the second inning runs as well, driving in Anthony Rendon and Wilson Ramos on a two-out double that just snuck past Braves third baseman Chris Johnson.</p>
<p>Medlen calmed down after that and exited after the seventh inning. He gave up three runs on seven hits, with eight strikeouts and three walks. </p>
<p>The Braves scored their first and only run of the game in the bottom of the seventh when Dan Uggla took Haren deep to left.</p>
<p>Dan Haren gave up another hit in the eighth and after a hard shot by Jordan Schafer for the second out, Davey Johnson came out for a pep talk. Haren proceeded to strike out Chris Johnson, ending his night on a high note.</p>
<p>Haren finished the eight innings on just 90 pitches, allowing the one run, on only four hits, four strikeouts and a walk. </p>
<p>Rafael Soriano came in for the ninth and earned his ninth save this season.</p>
<p>The Nationals will now head to Pittsburgh for a weekend series against the Pirates. Ryan Zimmerman is expected to return from the disabled list, while Jayson Werth will sit out with a hamstring issue that forced him to leave tonight’s game early.</p>

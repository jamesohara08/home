<h1>CT Buzz Williams</h1><b>March 25, 2014 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Hiring Buzz Williams as head coach of the Virginia Tech men’s basketball team was the most public signal of a change that has already been occurring within the Tech administration, and not just the athletic department. </p><p>With incoming president Tim Sands, new athletic director Whit Babcock and a plethora of new assistant coaches on the football team Tech has seen a rapid turnover among its highest paid staff members. </p><p>However, it took the hiring of the energetic and successful Williams to coach a basketball team that has long been an afterthought for the change to sink in. The future of Tech athletics is now. </p><p>That’s not to say that the previous administration were slouches.  In the past two decades the Hokies have moved on from the lowly Metro Conference to a power conference in the Atlantic Coast Conference, where they have excelled. </p><p>Tech sports teams have won 18 ACC championships, just four of those coming from the football program that made the school famous. In the past year, the baseball team hosted an NCAA Regional, the women’s soccer team made it to the College Cup and Devin Carter wrestled his way to a national championship match.  </p><p>So much for the one-trick pony critics often accused Tech sports of being. The athletic department has seen such a rapid growth in just a decade; it’s hard to remember the humble roots it so recently left. </p><p>Despite the numerous successes, both on and off the field, there is so much more for Tech athletics to accomplish. And in recent years many have noted a feeling of contentedness among the sports program, satisfied with the modicum of success they enjoyed. </p><p>However, the era of good feelings is no more, as the administration has finally taken the first steps towards that next level. Williams’ seven-year, $18 million contract signaled that the budget was no longer the one and only focus of the athletic department.</p><p>And fans have already bought in. They filled up seats at Cassell Coliseum just to see a press conference with the new head coach. And when Babcock came out to introduce the new hire, he was given a rousing ovation. </p><p>This sort of excitement for basketball hasn’t been seen in Blacksburg since Feb. 26, 2011, when the Hokies upset then-No. 1 Duke. Already fans have begun ordering season tickets for next season, despite the schedule not even being released yet. </p><p>Tech sports already have laid a foundation of success under the previous administration led by former director of athletics Jim Weaver, now the youthful experience of Babcock and Sands should lead the Hokies to levels of success that previously seemed just out of reach. </p>

<h1>Max Scherzer</h1><b>January 31, 2015</b><p>Max Scherzer is a Washington National. That’s still a sentence that takes some getting used to after he signed a massively-deferred seven year, $210 million contract. While there was some speculation that the Nats and Scherzer might get together, it mostly seemed like the sort of unfounded rumors based more on opinion than fact that plague every offseason. But here we are, with the Nationals holding a so-called super rotation in 2015 and adding another piece to their long term core.</p><p>I know, it’s scary to consider Scherzer’s age, 30, and look at just how long the Nats will be paying him for, (@MattsBats will be out of college before the contract is over!), but he’s also a really, really ridiculously good pitcher. Over the past three seasons Scherzer has amassed wins above replacement of 4.5, 6.4 and 5.6 according to FanGraphs. Among other current Nationals pitcher only Jordan Zimmermann (5.2, 2014) and Gio Gonzalez (5.1, 2012) can claim a single season with a higher WAR total over the same period. Oh and he also just happens to have the 2013 Cy Young Award. No big deal. </p><p>Scherzer represents a departure from usual business in a lot of ways for the Nats as well. For starters, this is only the second long term, big money free agent deal the Nationals have given out and it dwarfs the other one, Jayson Werth’s seven years and $126 million. It’s also a huge expenditure for a team that had previously publicly declared that they were up against their own self-imposed salary cap and has now seen the payroll rise by nearly $100 million since 2011. That was mostly due to the escalating salaries that come with arbitration, so making another full value commitment was understandably unexpected. </p><p>Scherzer’s chief main weapon is strikeouts. He’s had over 230 strikeouts in each of the last three seasons and strikeout rates of 29.4, 28.7 and 27.9 percent. The groundwork for such prodigious strikeout totals lies in his career swinging strike rate of 11.0. Scherzer gets hitters to chase at about an average rate, in 2014 opposing hitters swung at 29.8 percent of his pitches out of the strike zone just below the league average of 30.8 percent. But he does a good job limiting contact, especially on pitches inside the strike zone where opposing batters made contact just 81.8 percent of the time against him in 2014, compared to the league average of 87.5 percent. So he’s able to deceive hitters and rack up the Ks despite not getting them to chase pitches out of the zone.</p><p>That’s not to say he can only strike batters out. Scherzer is also a tick above average when it comes to walk rate, with a career rate of 7.6 percent. He also has a healthy career infield fly ball rate of 9.5 percent, which are the closest thing a ball in play gets to being a sure out. And for a fly ball pitcher, Scherzer has a career .95 groundball-to-fly ball ratio, inducing lots of pop ups is doubly important. His impeccably clean injury history is also a bonus.</p><p>Overall Scherzer is more of an investment in the Nationals future than an investment for the present, super rotations aside. Yes, long term free agent deals for starting pitchers rarely if ever work out, but with the way the contract is structured it shouldn’t put too much of a burden on future Nationals payrolls. Besides that is a concern for future you, that bastard who probably gets to sleep on his way to work in his self-driving car, that bastard. Present you gets to imagine exactly what a super rotation is and dream of many more.</p>

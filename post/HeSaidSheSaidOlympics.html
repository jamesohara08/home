<h1>He Said She Said Olympics</h1><b>February 06, 2014 Originally published in Collegiate Times with companion She Said</b><p>Just days removed from the quintessential American sporting event, the quintessential international sporting event begins: the Olympics. </p><p>Let’s first acknowledge that the Olympics’ supposed goal of fostering world peace and unity is bunk. With the acknowledged it is still a great event for viewing some of the world’s most obscure sports that could only have been found on ESPN 8: The Ocho. </p><p>While the Winter Olympics can’t compete with the weirdness that is race walking, it has some great competitions in its own right. </p><p>One of my favorite events is the biathlon, which is an incredible combination of long-distance cross country skiing and rifle shooting. While all biathlon events are great, the best is the mass start, where all of the competitors begin the event like a marathon. </p><p>Another great event is the skeleton, an individual event where competitors lay face down on a small sled and fly down a small course at breakneck speeds. The insanity of the sport alone is enough to make it interesting. </p><p>For events where Americans will do well, you cannot go wrong with speed skating. It has become one of the marquee events of the winter and the American team will again be sending an excellent crop of skaters. </p><p>The best of those skaters is long-track racer Shani Davis, who is participating in his third Olympics. Davis, who is No. 1 in the world in both of his events, is better known as the model for Frozone from Pixar’s movie “The Incredibles.” </p><p>Yes, Frozone is a real person and is as awesome as you would expect. </p><p>One of the more underrated aspects of the Olympics is the creative journalism it can spawn. Ignore the schmaltzy pieces being put out by the big journalists and seek out some of the more obscure stories. </p><p>One of the best sports bloggers, Dan Steinberg of the Washington Post, got his start by writing a cheese of the day post in his blog from the Winter Olympics in Turin in 2006. Finding some of the weirder pieces getting written will augment your Olympics experience. </p><p>If all you see of these Olympics are the primetime darlings like ice hockey and figure skating, you’ll still have an enjoyable experience. But if you want to have a great Olympic experience, take these two weeks to seek out the oddities. </p>

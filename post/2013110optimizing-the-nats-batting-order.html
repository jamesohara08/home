<h1>Optimizing the Nats Batting Order</h1><b>January 11, 2013</b><div class="entry-content">
<p class="MsoNormal">Batting order is a tricky subject, how much time should really be given to it?  While we know that having some order to a lineup is beneficial, at the end of the day it can only do so much. With that said since the Nationals and Adam LaRoche finally agreed to a two-year deal we finally know who the starting eight will be for the Nats in 2013. And those eight provide some interesting batting order decisions, such as where to put Jayson Werth and Bryce Harper, and how to balance the lineup for optimal performance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Right now there is a consensus three main rules for the Nats batting order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ryan Zimmerman bats third.</li>
<li>Denard Span bats leadoff.</li>
<li>Try to split same handed hitters up.</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">If we follow those three rules we come to a lineup that looks something like this, along with what hand they bat with and their 2012 triple slash:</p>
<ol>
<li>Denard Span, L, .283/.342/.395</li>
<li>Jayson Werth, R, .300/.387/.440</li>
<li>Ryan Zimmerman,R, .282/.346/.478</li>
<li>Bryce Harper,L, .270/.340/.477</li>
<li>Adam LaRoche,L, .271/.343/.510</li>
<li>Ian Desmond, R, .292/.335/.511</li>
<li>Danny Espinosa, S, .247/.315/.402</li>
<li>Kurt Suzuki, R, .267/.321/.404</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now if you wanted to truly alternate left-right-left-right then you could switch Zimmerman and Harper, still giving you an excellent lineup, just without the familiarity of Zim in the three hole. But how much of a benefit would truly<br/>
come from going to the alternating order instead of the familiar order?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To answer that we can look at a fun little online tool over at <a href="http://www.baseballmusings.com/cgi-bin/LineupAnalysis.py"><strong>Baseball Musings</strong></a> that does lineup analysis using on-base percentage and slugging percentage.  The tool runs those averages against historical data to determine how well a certain lineup will perform. While it isn’t a perfect system and it isn’t easy to determine how relevant the<br/>
historical data is to baseball now, it still can give us a rough idea of how a certain batting order would perform.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the first lineup is entered into the tool, it needs nine players so I added Jordan Zimmermann and his .246 OBP and .281 slugging % to represent the pitchers, it gave a runs per game average of 4.935. Compared to the 4.51 they scored last season that is a marked improvement, however it’s difficult to say just how accurate that number is. The alternating lineup gave a runs per game average of 4.936, an extremely slight increase over the first lineup, and with the added benefit of having no same-handed hitter consecutively.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now the Baseball Musings tool doesn’t just analyze a lineup it also provides what it believes is the most optimal lineup. For the Nats the top lineup produced 4.986 runs per game on average and looked like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jayson Werth</li>
<li>Adam LaRoche</li>
<li>Bryce Harper</li>
<li>Ryan Zimmerman</li>
<li>Ian Desmond</li>
<li>Kurt Suzuki</li>
<li>Denard Span</li>
<li>Danny Espinosa</li>
<li>Jordan Zimmermann</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">That’s weird, and definitely is an example that using only numbers might not always lead to the best solution.  While I doubt the Nationals are ready to bat Adam LaRoche second, there are still some interesting ideas there.  For one, the Nationals weren’t so far off in batting Werth leadoff last season, and keeping him near the top is probably a good idea. Also here again we see Harper third and Zimmerman fourth, so perhaps giving in to convention and batting Zim third isn’t the best decision for the Nats.</p>
<p>But that isn’t the only lineup optimization idea. In the excellent and directly named <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1597971294?tag=tangotiger-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=1597971294&amp;adid=1WTND1B79ES7FYJ1BD7E&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Finsidethebook.com%2Fee%2F"><strong>“The Book”</strong></a> there is some discussion of lineup optimization.  Sky Kalkman at Beyond the Box Score <a href="http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2009/3/17/795946/optimizing-your-lineup-by"><strong>sums </strong></a>it up nicely:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another way to look at things is to order the batting slots by the leveraged value of the out. In plain English (sort of), we want to know how costly making an out is by each lineup position, based on the base-out situations they most often find themselves in, and then weighted by how often each lineup spot comes to the plate. Here’s how the lineup spots rank in the importance of avoiding outs: #1, #4, #2, #5, #3, #6, #7, #8, #9</p></blockquote>
<p>Now if we follow this idea and apply it to the Nats lineup we get something that looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jayson Werth</li>
<li>Adam LaRoche</li>
<li>Bryce Harper</li>
<li>Ryan Zimmerman</li>
<li>Denard Span</li>
<li>Ian Desmond</li>
<li>Kurt Suzuki</li>
<li>Danny Espinosa</li>
<li>Jordan Zimmermann</li>
</ol>
<p>Again this looks weird with Adam LaRoche batting second, and even more so with Denard Span batting fifth.<br/>
However, when run through the analyzer it produced 4.956 runs per game, which is better than the first two lineups we came up with. Perhaps the baseball world isn’t quite ready for the radical ideas of lineup optimization, or perhaps<br/>
more factors need to be considered that will give results we’re more used to. Regardless we can still use this information to make an informed decision on how to order the Nats lineup.</p>
<p>Taking all this into consideration I think the second lineup (Span, Werth, Harper, Zim, ALR)  would probably be the best lineup for the Nats.  It follows the third and fourth lineups fairly closely and takes into account speed and what side the batter hits from, which those lineups do not. Alternating left-right-left throughout the lineup will neutralize how opposing managers use their bullpen, and the entire lineup has balance between speed and power. While it breaks rule number one I think it will be beneficial to both Harper and Zimmerman to bat 3-4. However, there is no question that whatever way Davey Johnson decides to order his lineup, it will be potent from top to bottom.</p>

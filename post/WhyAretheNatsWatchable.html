<h1>Why Are the Nats Watchable</h1><b>May 5, 2023</b><p>There's a strong consensus that the Nats are way more watchable this year than last which I find interesting. First because this team has no star player on the level of Josh Bell, let alone Juan Soto. And second, because many of the same people calling the team watchable were also calling this the worst vibes a Nats team has ever had entering spring training. So I dug into some numbers to try to figure out what changed by comparing the first 30 games of 2022 and 2023.</p><p>I know what you’re going to say and It’s not youth. Well, it’s probably not youth. As for the Major League rosters, the 2022 Nats had five regulars (starting position players or pitchers) that were 25 and under, while the 2023 Nats also have five. So they have the exact same number of young guys trying to cut it in the big leagues. Now I said probably up there because there is a difference in who the players are, last year’s count had Soto who is lightyears better than anyone this year, but also included Joan Adon and Robles. This year at least has five players you expect to see still here by next year (Ruiz, García, Abrams, Gore, Gray) but is missing a superstar unless someone significantly exceeds expectations.</p><p>So if it’s not that, then maybe it’s because they’re just playing better baseball. That doesn’t seem to be the case offensively as things are basically a wash. In 2022 the team averaged a .254/.319/.366 triple slash good for a 93 wRC+, while the 2023 team has put up a remarkably similar .251/.314/.351 but worse 82 wRC+ (offense is back!). As expected with the new rules the Nats have nearly twice as many stolen bases 17 to 9 in 2022, but on home runs they’re again nearly even 18 in ‘23 to 20 in ‘22, so I don’t think it’s big events either. The main difference is at an individual level where the 2022 team had four starters with a wRC+ at 100 or better (Soto, Bell, Y. Hernandez, Franco) in 2023 there’s only one, Robles. But I would expect that to make the team less watchable, not more.</p><p>On the pitching side things get more interesting as we see a strong difference in results from similar underlying stats. As a team, in 2022 Nats pitchers struck 21 percent and walked 10 percent of batters they faced, very close to their 2023 rates of 20 percent strikeouts and 10 percent walks. The 2022 staff managed to avoid homers better giving them a better FIP (4.19, 4.59 in 2023) but overall that didn’t help them keep runs off the board as their 4.92 ERA was 20 percentage points worse than the league average, while the 2023 staff is giving up a half run less at 4.32 just above league average. </p><p>When you’re watching the game you’re seeing the ERA not the FIP, so it’s not surprising that folks could have stronger positive feelings about the 2023 staff even if their other stats suggest their due for a regression toward last year. However, there’s an even more telling narrative stat for Nats pitchers, in 2023 they have a Win Probability Added of just below zero (-0.44) not significantly impacting the game positively or negatively. While in 2022, in just 30 games, the pitchers had already racked up -2.63 Win Probability Added meaning they had a decent number of games where the pitching staff was incinerating good games. Those negative feelings can build up quick. </p><p>At the overall team level we see a similar story of how sequencing can help build a narrative. In 2022, the Nats were 10-20, in last place by 10 games, won three series and had been outscored by 30 runs. To start this season, the Nats were 12-18, in last place by 8.5 games, won four series and had been outscored by 26 runs. But the paths they took tell the story, the 2022 team was in a surprise 2nd place for a few days before losing 7 games in a row, while this year the Nats have never been above a tie for third at the beginning of the season, but three of their four series wins have come in the last two weeks. The human brain loves to find patterns and will draw a lot of its opinion from them even if the overall result is the same.</p><p>But the real reason I wrote this was because I had a hypothesis that the biggest reason making this year’s Nats more watchable was the pitch clock. If you’re stuck watching bad baseball faster will always be better than slower and the Nats have been way faster with an average game time of two hours and 37 minutes, which is 33 (!!) minutes fewer than last year when it was three hours and 10 minutes. That alone is a massive difference, but I think the quicker pitch-to-pitch has helped too as it lets the fan stay focused on the game easier, which means less angry tweets and more noticing the little improvements the young players are making which hopefully signals better times ahead. Turns out there are some other pretty convincing reasons so I can’t say for certain it’s the pitch clock, but I’d wager it’s making an impact.</p>

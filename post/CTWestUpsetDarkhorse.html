<h1>CT West Upset Darkhorse</h1><b>March 21, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Upset Watch</p><p>Marshall Henderson will continue his reign of terror and Ole Miss will keep up their winning ways after taking the SEC Championship. A 12-seed in the tournament the Rebels nonetheless have a fairly easy path to the Sweet Sixteen with only Wisconsin and likely Kansas State in their way. Hendersonâ€™s three-point shooting will be key to a long Rebels run, while Murphy Holloway and Reginald Buckner should clean up on the glass.</p><p>Dark Horse Candidate</p><p>A top ten team before conference play the Arizona Wildcats have fallen off and are an under the radar sixth seed heading into the tournament. Still, the Wildcats -- led by senior forward Solomon Hill, are the same team that beat Miami by 19 and Florida by one earlier this season. If the Wildcats can find that earlier form the bracket sets up well for them to make a run.</p>

<h1>ACC Roundup 1</h1><b>September 17, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>With two of the ACC’s three ranked teams – Clemson and Miami – taking the weekend off and no ACC team facing a top 25 opponent, it was a fairly boring weekend for the conference. This is your ACC Roundup.</p><p>#10 Florida State 62 Nevada 7: </p><p>After completing 92.6% of his passes in Florida State’s opening weekend beat down of Pittsburgh, freshman phenom Jameis Winston suffered a letdown against the Wolf Pack, completing just 83.3%. In addition to Winston the Seminoles had a pair of running backs rush for over 100 yards and a touchdown. Devonta Freeman ran nine times for 109 yards, while Karlos Williams ran eight times for 110.</p><p>Georgia Tech 38 Duke 14:</p><p>In the only in-conference action this weekend the Yellow Jackets shocked the world by scoring four touchdowns through this newfangled invention called the forward pass. Quarterback Vad Lee also added a four-yard rushing touchdown and the Yellow Jackets had their way with a stout Blue Devils defense.</p><p>Maryland 32 Connecticut 21:</p><p>In the now annual Edsall Bowl, named for former Huskies and current Terrapins head coach Randy Edsall, the Terps scored 19 second half points to pull away from the Huskies. Quarterback C.J. Brown continued to impress, while Stefon Diggs did Stefon Diggs things. The win moved the Terps to 3-0 for the first time since 2001.</p><p>USC 35 Boston College 7:</p><p>The Eagles defied expectations by managing to score a touchdown late in the game. Chase Rettig continued to be Chase Rettig, completing 11 of 23 passes for 83 yards in his 35th straight start for the Eagles. At this point one has to wonder if Chase Rettig will just be the quarterback for the Eagles for the rest of his life, with nobody caring enough to notice. </p><p>Pittsburgh 49 New Mexico 27:</p><p>The Panthers made sure not to embarrass their new conference in only their second game by rolling against the Lobos. The Panthers ran up 527 yards of total offense, but because this is Pitt they made sure to still turn the ball over four times. </p><p>Syracuse 54 Wagner 0:</p><p>Like Pitt, the Orange were looking to not embarrass the ACC in their third game in it and accomplished that by handily defeating whatever a Wagner is. It was the first victory for Scott Shafer as head coach of the Orange. The Orange will move on to a Tulane team that lost to South Alabama two weeks ago. Baby steps people. </p><p>Louisiana-Monroe 21 Wake Forest 19:</p><p>It seems that every week the Demon Deacons find more new and interesting teams to lose to. You may remember the Warhawks from their victory over then-#8 Arkansas last season that sent the Razorbacks into their death spiral. The Demon Deacons managed just 15 yards rushing against their small conference foe. Try again next week guys. </p><p>That’s it for ACC action this weekend. Remember to tune in Thursday night to see if #3 Clemson can avoid Clemsoning against NC State. And #goacc. </p>

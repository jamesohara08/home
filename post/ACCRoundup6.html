<h1>ACC Roundup 6</h1><b>October 09, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>This is the first year in the history of the ACC that three ACC teams have a record of 5-0. This is also the first year of me writing the ACC Roundup. You can draw your own conclusions. This is your ACC Roundup.</p><p>Florida State 63 – Maryland 0: This game was like when you’re a little kid playing basketball against your dad and he’s nice enough to let you run past him and score some points. You then get up enough courage to taunt him a little bit and he decides to launch your next shot clear into the neighbor’s lawn to teach you a lesson about humility. In this case Maryland is you and Jameis Winston is your Heisman-trophy contending father.</p><p>Miami 45 – Georgia Tech 30: The Hurricanes trailed in a game for the first time this season and responded by going on a 38-6 run, before letting the Yellow Jackets score a face-saving touchdown with 10 seconds to go. The Yellow Jackets meanwhile are now looking at a season where their signature win so far is on the road against Duke.</p><p>Clemson 49 – Syracuse 14: The Tigers ran away with the game, they led 35-7 at halftime, but Syracuse was wearing some spiffy looking helmets. And as we all know the recruits can’t resist spiffy looking helmets. So sorry Tigers, but it looks like the Orange have won this round. </p><p>Wake Forest 28 – North Carolina State 13: Tanner Price had the best game of his career – which I know is a really low bar to clear but stay with me here- completing 62% of his passes for 268 yards while accounting for four touchdowns. With the Demon Deacons victory we came one step closer to completing the 2013 ACC <a href="http://kegsneggsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/439164698.jpg">Circle</a> of <a href="http://gamedayr.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/reddit-acc-college-football-2012-570x570.jpg">Suck</a>. </p><p>Boston College 48 – Army 27: Did you know the Eagles have the third leading rusher in the country? Did you also know that in this game he ran for 263 yards and five touchdowns, missing the school record by a yard? Well it’s true. That man is Andre Williams and he in fact lost that record-tying yard in his last carry of the game, which might be the most Boston College thing ever.</p><p>All right I won’t keep you all waiting any longer, but as they say you should save the best for last. </p><p>Ball State 48 – Virginia 27: Up to this point the thing Ball State was best known for was probably this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W45DRy7M1no">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W45DRy7M1no</a> </p><p>Yes the Cavaliers lost by 21 to the school that begat that mess of a human being. </p><p>And if that wasn’t enough schadenfreude for you, you can read <a href="http://www.streakingthelawn.com/2013/9/24/4766988/uva-football-acc-schedule-bowl-predictions-streaking-the-lawn-roundtable">this</a>. And boom goes the dynamite. </p><p>That’s it for this week’s ACC roundup. We’re just two weeks away from Clemson-Florida State which, as long as the Tigers can get past Boston College this weekend, will be the most high profile ACC game in at least a decade. So get excited and remember #goacc.</p>

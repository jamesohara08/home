<h1>Homefield Advantage</h1><b>September 17, 2014</b><p>As the calendar moves toward late September and more teams punch their tickets to the Major League Baseball postseason talk inevitably turns from making the playoffs to getting home field advantage in the playoffs. But how much of an advantage is having home field? </p><p>To start, if having home field advantage in the playoffs is beneficial the team holding it should naturally win more games than their opponents.  Below, I’ve taken the average number of playoff wins by the best team in each league, the second best team in each league and so forth since MLB introduced the wild card. A key note is that this isn’t necessarily in strict playoff seeding order, since a wild card winner could have a better record than a division winner. However, the best record will always have home field advantage. </p><p>&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://cf.datawrapper.de/U7rtO/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p><p>There appears to be some natural advantage to having the best record in the league heading into the playoffs, as those teams win about two more playoff games than their peers. It doesn’t seem like much, but when just 11 wins, or 12 for a wild card now, takes the World Series crown, two wins can make a big difference. The problem is that this seems to be a tautological statement. It should be obvious that the best team has the most wins.</p><p>To get a better idea of the specific benefit of home field advantage, we need to find how much a team’s chances of winning improve by playing at home. By taking the average regular season win percentage at home by MLB teams over the same period we can get a rudimentary idea of the chance an average team would have at winning a home game.</p><p>&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://cf.datawrapper.de/pnl8I/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p><p>Now this includes non-playoff teams as well, but it should be a more representative sample since playoffs teams will naturally win more games and thus have a higher win percentage. The average over all the years is .539, so an average team would expect to win about 53.9 percent of the time when playing at home. So the average team with home field advantage would have an extra game where they have a six percent higher chance of winning than their opponent based just on playing at home. However, the team still needs to get to that final game to see the advantage. </p><p>There’s one last possible advantage to being the top overall seed, the wild card game. With the addition of the second wild card in 2012 the wild card teams have a one game play-in before the division series. Three of the eight teams in this game had their best starter pitch in the play-in game and would likely not have had him available for game one. Teams often line up their division series rotation so they can have their best starter pitch both games one and five, so not having him available could be an advantage to the top overall seed that faces them. </p><p>Win Probability Added or WPA, which uses Tom Tango’s win expectancy charts to directly measure how much a player contributes to his team’s chances of winning a game, can give a rough idea of the difference. For the three wild card teams that pitcher their ace, the 2012 Texas Rangers, the 2012 Atlanta Braves and the 2013 Cincinnati Reds, the average WPA of their aces was 2.11 wins and the average WPA of their second best starters was 1.77 wins. In a short series, that a difference of .34 wins doesn’t seem insignificant. However, we’ll need more data to know for sure how much of an advantage this potentially presents. </p><p>Overall, having home field advantage and being the top overall seed in the playoffs likely does give a marginal boost to that team. And in a postseason which is just a celebrated small sample size a marginal boost can make a big difference. </p><p> </p>

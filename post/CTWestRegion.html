<h1>CT West Region</h1><b>March 20, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Every team in the West Region will be trying to play their way to Phoenix, Arizona for a chance to make it to Atlanta and the Final Four.</p><p>The West Region is home to the AP No. 1 team the Gonzaga Bulldogs and national Player of the Year candidate Kelly Olynyk.  But the Bulldogs will have their hands full with the tough competition the NCAA tournament presents.</p><p>The West Region is probably the most wide open region, with a number of popular upset picks with the potential to make it to the Sweet Sixteen and possibly beyond.</p><p>The favorites to take the West Regionâ€™s bid into the Final Four are the Bulldogs, the second-seeded Ohio State Buckeyes, and the third-seeded New Mexico Lobos. Outside of those three though former top 10 teams like the fifth-seeded Wisconsin Badgers and sixth-seeded Arizona Wildcats will present a tough out. </p><p>What really gives the NCAA Tournament its March Madness nickname though is first round upsets and the West Region is filled with upset candidates.</p><p>The team with perhaps the best chance to pull of some major upsets is the 12th-seeded Ole Miss Rebels and their controversial star Marshall Henderson. Henderson is a prolific three-point shooter and if he can get hot the Rebels could go far.</p><p>While the West Region is home to some top teams with Final Four and Championship potential anything can happen in March.</p>

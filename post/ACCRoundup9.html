<h1>ACC Roundup 9</h1><b>October 30, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>It was “Don’t Mess This Up” Weekend in the ACC as all four of the ACC’s top 15 teams were facing tough unranked conference foes between big games. Florida State passed with flying colors, the other three not so much. This is your ACC Roundup. </p><p>Florida State 49 – North Carolina State 17: You think the Seminoles were still a bit upset over their upset loss to the Wolfpack last year? They racked up 35 points, 269 yards of offense and forced two Wolfpack turnovers in the first quarter alone. There is no truth to the rumor that the fans at Doak Campbell Stadium were screaming out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAUY1J8KizU">this</a> at the end of the quarter.</p><p>Miami 24 – Wake Forest 21: Meanwhile on the other side of the “great” state of Florida, things weren’t so easy for the ACC Coastal’s top 10 team. The Hurricanes needed a Duke Johnson touchdown with less than a minute left to beat the Demon Deacons. This likely does not bode well for their big matchup against the Seminoles next weekend. However, the game will probably fit in perfectly with the slasher flick Halloween theme. </p><p>Clemson 40 – Maryland 27: The Tigers struggled early but eventually pulled ahead of the MASH unit that is the Terrapins these days. The win keeps them on track for a possible second BCS berth for the ACC, which would be the conference’s second in three years, which is an odd sentence to type. Meanwhile, the Big Ten seems to be intentionally making itself worse to make Maryland feel more at home next season, which sure is swell of them. </p><p>Georgia Tech 35 – Virginia 25: The Yellow Jackets defeated the terrible Cavaliers, which in theory makes sense. However, one of these beat BYU, the other didn’t and they were the victors of today’s game, which flies right in the face of the transitive property. Take that, math! </p><p>Navy 24 – Pittsburgh 21: Last week the Panthers nearly loss to an FCS school and nobody noticed, this week the Panthers lost to Navy and still nobody seemed to notice. Soon the Panthers will find themselves trapped in the Boston College zone, where year after year opposing schools forget you’re in the conference until you show up on the schedule for that week. It is a truly sad existence, let’s move on. </p><p>North Carolina 34 – Boston College 10: This is a game that actually happened, which one would think would qualify as a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. Chase Rettig was 10/20 for 57 yards and why did somebody let this happen? Let us never speak of this again. </p><p>That’s it for this week in ACC action. Be sure to see this weekend whether Miami suffers a quick and messy or slow and painful death at the hands of the Seminoles and remember, #goacc.  </p>

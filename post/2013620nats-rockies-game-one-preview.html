<h1>Nats-Rockies Game One Preview</h1><b>June 20, 2013</b><div class="entry-content">
<p>So TJ mistakenly trusted me with doing this weekend’s preview and I completely missed that this weekend’s series starts today so here’s a super quick preview for tonight’s game. </p>
<p>The Colorado Rockies make the return visit to DC for a four game set starting tonight. Tonight the Nats will face a familiar opponent in starting pitcher Roy Oswalt. Oswalt is making his first start for the Rockies after a few warm-up starts in the minors. It remains to be seen how much of the old Oswalt is still in him, but the Nats history against him does not inspire hope. </p>

<p>Ryan Zimmerman is the only current National to be able to hit Oswalt with any sort of success. A team OPS of .662 isn’t good for an offense that has already had a full season’s worth of struggles this year. If Oswalt has even a fraction of the effectiveness he had in his heyday it could be a long night for the Nationals. </p>
<p>The Nats offense should have plenty of opportunties to grab a win though, as Jordan Zimmermann takes the mound for the Nats.  </p>

<p>Interestingly Zimmermann has never faced Rockies star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. That won’t be rectified tonight as Tulowitzki went on the disabled list after suffering a rib injury the last time these two teams met.</p>
<p>Overall, Zimmermann is successful against the Rockies, holding them to a team OPS of .628. Jordan Pacheco’s .900 OPS in six at-bats are a bit surprising to see, but is likely just a product of random variation.</p>
<p>From the numbers, tonight is shaping up to be a pitcher’s duel, the Nationals will be looking to have it fall in their favor in order to even up their record at .500 once again. </p>

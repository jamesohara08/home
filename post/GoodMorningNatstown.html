<h1>Good Morning Natstown</h1><b>March 10, 2015</b><p>Dave typically likes to use this space for a daily monologue, but I’m lazy and we have some actual real Nationals news to get to so let’s hit the links. </p><p>We also don’t have time for a long plea for the Washington Baseball Annual, Vol. III so it’s time for what The Simpsons dubbed superliminal advertising. Hey you! Buy the Washington Baseball Annual, Vol. III! </p><p>Yesterday morning the Nats announced that starting center fielder Denard Span underwent his second surgery of the offseason to repair what was deemed by the team a right core muscle injury. This is bad news for both the Nats and Span. With Jayson Werth already sidelined for the spring and likely a week or two into the season the last thing the Nats needed was to lose another part of their starting outfield. For Span, who’s coming off one of the best seasons in his career when he put up 3.8 wins above replacement by FanGraphs, having a second surgery in his core area is a significant concern. While the Nats’ initial timeline is four to six weeks, it sounds much more likely that he exceeds that estimate rather than beat it. </p><p>The Nats will now move on with top outfield prospect Michael Taylor to start the season. Nats General Manager Mike Rizzo evidently informed the soon-to-be 24 year old centerfielder of the move a few days ago. Taylor, who is a consensus top 100 prospect, has legitimate talent and is projected by ZiPS to put up 1.9 WAR in 2015 if given full time at-bats, but like all prospects he has some rough edges. Luckily for Taylor he now has an entire spring to prepare for the role. </p><p>In non-injury news Spring Training continues to roll on, moving from the exciting beginnings to the month long march to the regular season. And now that we’ve gotten to the meaty pat of Spring Training it’s time for the annual reminder that spring stats are largely irrelevant. Harper Gordek of Nationals Baseball takes that bullet this year, writing up the warning in the context of 28 year old AAAA slugger Tyler Moore’s hot start. </p><p>Over at Nationals 101 (or is it Nats 101? They really have to sort out that branding.) Frank continues their series of articles preparing for the upcoming season. Yesterday, Frank took a look at the four Nationals (Yunel Escobar, Ryan Zimmerman, Bryce Harper and Jayson Werth) who will be starting at a new position this year. Well that’s only half true, the focus here is on the two infielders since he’s already written about the Harper/Werth swap. With some rough initial estimates of how they will adjust to the job, and some very nice and unexpected words about yours truly, Frank gives a great breakdown of the questions facing the two as they move from the left side of the infield to the right. </p><p>Finally, if you prefer listening to reading, over at Banished to the Pen, good friend and podcaster extraordinaire Ryan Sullivan welcomes Baseball Prospectus math guru Russell Carleton. They discuss a wide range of baseball topics including the grind of the long season, the value of managers and the need for more women in sportswriting, without any of that scary, gory math. </p><p>Until the next time David Huzzard is incapacitated, good morning, good afternoon and goodnight Natstown. </p>

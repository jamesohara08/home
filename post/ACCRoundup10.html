<h1>ACC Roundup 10</h1><b>November 06, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Last Saturday it was revealed that Florida State freshmen sensation Jameis Winston played without contacts, despite needing them, requiring him to squint to see the play calls. Inspired, Virginia Tech suggested fans do the same when the Hokies offense takes the field. This is your ACC Roundup. </p><p>Florida State 41 – Miami 14: Another undefeated, top 10 ACC opponent and another savage beat down by the Seminoles.  To their credit the Hurricanes kept the game close at halftime, something the Clemson Tigers did not do. The win continued the Seminoles Spy vs. Spy back and forth with the Oregon Ducks for the number two ranking in the BCS. </p><p>Clemson 59 – Virginia 10: One of the world’s greatest mysteries is how this Cavaliers team managed to beat BYU in their season opener, ranking right between how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop and who shot Mr. Burns. In other news, Tigers quarterback Tajh Boyd is now all alone atop the ACC all-time rankings for touchdowns accounted for, which is neat. </p><p>Georgia Tech 21 – Pittsburgh 10: At first glance this game doesn’t seem all that important, but with the way the Coastal Division’s has been going lately you can never be sure. Tom Savage continued to be savagely (heh) beaten, as the Yellow Jackets racked up a season-high five sacks on the poor Panthers quarterback. This was the first time these two teams met since the Bicentennial and yet neither team wore gaudy patriotic uniforms, which seems like a real missed opportunity. </p><p>Syracuse 13 – Wake Forest 0: For some reason these two teams are being allowed to continue to play football and the results were exactly as you would expect. The only scoring came in the third quarter when the Orange scored two touchdowns in three minutes. The point after try was blocked on the second touchdown, because of course it was. This is why we can’t have nice things. </p><p>North Carolina 27 – North Carolina State 19: Both teams put on a good show, but you could tell they were just going through the motions in anticipation of shooty hoops season. The Wolfpack remain winless in the ACC, a distinction they share with the Cavaliers, making the 2013 ACC Circle of Suck appear to be more of a pipe dream at this point. To display your dismay with their dreadfulness the ACC Roundup suggests referring to them as the Wolfpacks from now on, losers don’t deserve cool singular team names. </p><p>That’s it for ACC action this week. The ACC Roundup would like to point out that there is a real possibility that the Coastal Division finishes in a five-way tie for first place, because nobody wants to face Florida State in the ACC Championship Game. And on that note we bid you adieu and remember, #goacc. </p>

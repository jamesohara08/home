<h1>ACC Roundup 5</h1><b>October 02, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>This week the ACC nearly had five teams ranked in the top 25 with two legitimate national title contenders, we’re through the looking glass people. This is your ACC roundup.</p><p>Florida State 48 – Boston College 34: The Eagles got off to a fast start going up 17-3 early. The Seminoles eventually got it together to take what should have been an easy victory. Jameis Winston doubled his career interception total, to two, while throwing four touchdown passes. </p><p>Miami 49 - South Florida 21: The Hurricanes concluded their tour of Florida with a romp over the Bulls. That’s three wins over Florida-based teams in their first four games. The Hurricanes have yet to trail in a game this season, which might finally be the year where “The U” is back. </p><p>Clemson 56 – Wake Forest 7: The Demon Deacons managed to score a touchdown on a catch by Sherman Ragland III late in the first quarter, so chalk this one up as a moral victory. Tigers quarterback Tajh Boyd eclipsed 100 career touchdowns accounted for, making him the second ACC quarterback after Philip Rivers to do so. </p><p>East Carolina 55 – North Carolina 31: </p><p>East Carolina Offense vs. Virginia Tech: 10 points, 204 total yards, three turnovers and 15 first downs.</p><p>East Carolina Offense vs. Tar Heels: 55 points, 603 total yards, one turnover and 36 first downs.</p><p>Moving on.</p><p>Pittsburgh 14 – Virginia 3: The Virginia offense made their in-state rivals, Virginia Tech, look like Oregon with a lethargic performance against the Panthers. The Cavaliers and Panthers combined for 17 punts and five turnovers, so a stereotypical ACC game. </p><p>Duke 38 – Troy 31: No wonder Lane Kiffin was fired by USC. A loss to the Blue Devils is embarrassing to any team, but especially to the mighty Trojans. Oh sorry, wrong Trojans. The Blue Devils did just enough not to embarrass the conference, which is all we ask of them. Keep it up guys. </p><p>North Carolina State 48 – Central Michigan 14: North Carolina State took advantage of one of the directional Michigan after a frustrating loss to Clemson. The Wolfpack sprinted out to a 35-0 lead at halftime, scoring on both sides of the ball. In other news, the Chippewas have a running back named Maurice Shoemaker-Gilmore, which is kind of cool. </p><p>That’s it for ACC action this week. Be sure to tune in next week for the first battle between ranked ACC teams when Florida State and Maryland face off and remember #goacc. </p>

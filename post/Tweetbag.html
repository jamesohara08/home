I’m not a health expert and generally despise health journalism as a whole because it leads to charts like the one below, but overall I don’t see any way the Nats’ nutrition is leading to injuries. That’s just a part of trying to do unnatural motions repetitively for years. </p><p><a href="https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4TEEadAyajx-WHVwvMsni0gOBbQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3523382/Medical_studies-05.0.png">https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4TEEadAyajx-WHVwvMsni0gOBbQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3523382/Medical_studies-05.0.png</a></p><p>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nextyeardc&quot;&gt;@nextyeardc&lt;/a&gt; Assuming Zimm Fister &amp;amp; maybe Stras not on 16&amp;#39; team, who takes spots on staff? Roark? Jordan? Treinen? Cole? Giolito? F.A. Other?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Denning Family (@fam_Denn) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fam_Denn/status/580446578378481664&quot;&gt;March 24, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p><p>&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p><p>Zimmermann and Fister are both free agents after this season so it isn’t insane to assume they’re not on the 2016 team. Strasburg, however, is not a free agent until after the 2016 season, so I don’t see any realistic way that he isn’t pitching for the Nationals then. </p><p>That still leaves two open spots. Tanner Roark is poised to move into one of the roles left open and he should at least be able to be an effective No. 4/5 starter, so pencil him in. The last spot is a bit tricky, A.J. Cole would certainly have had plenty of time in the minors by then with a full year of AAA likely under his belt. And Giolito is the best pitching prospect in baseball and could launch himself into the conversation with a strong 2015. However, the free agent starting pitching market will be loaded next year with David Price, Zack Greinke, Johnny Cueto, Jeff Samardzija, Mat Latos, Yovani Gallardo, Hisashi Iwakuma, Justin Masterson and Rick Porcello all joining Fister and Zimmermann on the open market. If ever a team was looking for a fair rate on a free agent starting pitcher, next offseason would be the time to grab one. </p><p>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nextyeardc&quot;&gt;@nextyeardc&lt;/a&gt; If Ramos has injury causing longterm absence, do Nats go shopping for a C or rely on in house options?  Who are best candidates?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Denning Family (@fam_Denn) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fam_Denn/status/580446846159572992&quot;&gt;March 24, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p><p>&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p><p>The Nationals traded for Jose Lobaton for this exact reason last year and he’ll fill that role well again this year. His career 81 wRC+ does leave a lot to be desired, but at a position where the league average is a 93 wRC+ it’s difficult to ask much more of a backup. He also grades out well by Baseball Prospectus’ advanced catcher metrics, saving 4.7 runs through pitch framing in 3611 chances. Overall, he’s a more than competent backup and fill in catcher.</p><p>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nextyeardc&quot;&gt;@nextyeardc&lt;/a&gt; Did you break down the Nats bullpen yet?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; The Natidude (@TheNatidude) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheNatidude/status/580445601202106369&quot;&gt;March 24, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p><p>&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p><p>No, with the Nationals I tend to find its best to wait until they’ve made a decision before doing a full analysis. Last season everyone, including myself, was convinced that Ross Detwiler would be the Nats fifth starter and not one but two different pitchers, Tanner Roark and Taylor Jordan, beat him out for the spot. I think I have a pretty good notion of who will be in the pen on Opening Day (Storen, Janssen, Thornton, Stammen, Blevins, Barrett, Roark), but expect to see at least one of those pitchers replaced by another name. </p><p>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nextyeardc&quot;&gt;@nextyeardc&lt;/a&gt; is it OK to wear Expos gear to a Nats game? question 2: are you old enough to remember the Expos?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Half St Heart Blog (@HalfStreetHeart) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HalfStreetHeart/status/580419666885099521&quot;&gt;March 24, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p><p>&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p><p>Sure, it’s your body put whatever the hell you want on it. Provided it’s legal. Some jerk might try to quiz you on the Expos to prove you’re a horrific phony, so either bone up on your Expos trivia or tell Holden Caulfield to go assassinate another beloved musician. </p><p>Oh and yes I am old enough to remember the Expos. I even went to one of their exhibition games against the Cardinals back in 1999 at RFK. </p><p>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nextyeardc&quot;&gt;@nextyeardc&lt;/a&gt; 1) Why do kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2) How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mike Sankey (@msankey86) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/msankey86/status/580417536468058113&quot;&gt;March 24, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p><p>&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p><p>1) According to the cereal makers themselves it’s because it has the taste you (the child) can see.

There’s no realistic trade involving Tyler Moore that would seriously help the Nationals, because Moore just wouldn’t command that price. With Moore being out of options he either makes the Nats or is designated for assignment. There’s also a possibility they give him his outright release as they did with Jeff Kobernus as a favor. The more likely DFA could result in many things, being claimed on waivers, becoming a free agent or accepting a AAA job with the Nats. In any case, Moore would be available easily and cheaply to any team that would want him. That’s just not an asset that will command something of value in a trade.</p><p>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nextyeardc&quot;&gt;@nextyeardc&lt;/a&gt; Tony Gwynn was a 2.5-win player in 2009. What will it take for him to regain that form?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrew Flax (@AndrewFlaxTNB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AndrewFlaxTNB/status/580126044436430848&quot;&gt;March 23, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p><p>&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p><p>A time machine. *rimshot*</p><p>Gwynn’s success in 2009 was built on a well above career average batting average on balls in play of .316, his career rate is .287. A good amount of playing time and 27-year old legs in center field also helped him get to that 2.5 win plateau. </p><p>He’ll likely never get there with the Nationals, because it would take way more playing time than he is likely to get for him to accumulate 2.5 wins. He’s also 32, making it unlikely that he suddenly has a breakthrough at the plate leading to more hard hit balls that can raise his BABIP. His career defensive numbers are good though, so he could be of mild use as a backup, but he should never be stepping foot in the batter’s box. </p><p>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nextyeardc&quot;&gt;@nextyeardc&lt;/a&gt; Popeyes or Bojangles?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; David Huzzard (@DavidHuzzard) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DavidHuzzard/status/580126794222825474&quot;&gt;March 23, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p><p>&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p><p>Either. Both. I’ve been to both establishments and have enjoyed the food they serve. Food should never be pitted against other food, they’re all here to serve the same purpose, provide necessary nutrition in a palatable manner. Having strong opinions about food is the idiot’s way to feeling superior. Don’t be an idiot and enjoy what you have in front of you. </p>

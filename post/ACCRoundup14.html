<h1>ACC Roundup 14</h1><b>January 8, 2014</b><p>The ACC got a record 11 teams into bowls this year, which just goes to show there are some real benefits to crippling mediocrity. With so many games and dumb families with their “holidays” getting in the way though, the best ACC fan could hardly be expected to see them all, so the ACC Roundup is here to help. Consider it a belated Christmas gift, sorry “generic holiday season” gift. This is your ACC Roundup.</p><p>Pittsburgh 30 – Bowling Green 27: The Panthers’ superb freshmen stole the show. With running back James Conner rushing for 229 yards and a touchdown and receiver Tyler Boyd catching eight passes for 173 yards while returning a punt for a score. However, the big story from the game was that they <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2013/12/26/5246220/little-ceasar-bowl-has-no-pizza">ran out of pizza for the media</a> at the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl. How anyone could allow such a travesty to occur is befuddling.</p><p>Marshall 31 – Maryland 20: In their last game as members of the ACC, the Terrapins were thoroughly outmatched by their Conference USA foes. Thundering Herd quarterback Rakeem Cato dominated, passing for 337 yards and three touchdowns. The Terrapins will now move on to the Big Ten and after this performance in the Military Bowl they will likely not be missed.</p><p>Syracuse 21 – Minnesota 17: Speaking of the Big Ten, the Orange scored a huge win by taking down a good Gophers team in the Texas Bowl. Orange quarterback Terrel Hunt scrambled for the winning touchdown with just 1:14 remaining in the game after a 70-yard punt return by Brisly Estime. Syracuse head coach Scott Shafer said afterwards that “Brisly is as quick as a jitterburg.” Moving on.</p><p>North Carolina 39 – Cincinnati 17:  North Carolina fans made the long trek to Charlotte, NC to see the Tar Heels deny the Bearcats a second consecutive Belk Bowl title. That might have been the saddest sentence written about college football this year. Wait no, this next one is. Bearcats quarterback Brendon Kay threw for just 181 yards on 35 attempts; not to be outdone, Tar Heels quarterback Marquise Williams passed for 171 yards on 33 attempts. The win was the Tar Heels’ first Belk Bowl victory after losing their first three appearances in the in-state bowl game. Nope, that was it.</p><p>Louisville 36 – Miami 9: For the second consecutive year Cardinals quarterback Teddy Bridgewater thrashed a team from his home state in a bowl game. Last year Bridgewater threw for 266 yards and two touchdowns in a Sugar Bowl upset of Florida. He followed that up this year with 447 yards and three touchdowns against the Hurricanes in the Russell Athletic Bowl. Florida State is lucky that Bridgewater decided to turn pro before their meeting next year. The Hurricanes meanwhile are still without a bowl game victory since 2006 and now turn their eyes to 2014 as the year they are finally “back”.</p><p>Ole Miss 25 – Georgia Tech 17: There was one doctor still operating over the holiday break, as Dr. Bo Wallace carved up the Yellow Jackets defense. Wallace passed for 256 and a touchdown while adding another 86 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. The good doctor broke Eli Manning’s records at Ole Miss for passing yards and completions in a season. On the other side of the field, Yellow Jackets quarterback Vad Lee refused to take his Reggie Ball shot and threw the game ending interception to seal the Rebels victory in the Music City Bowl.</p><p>Arizona 42 – Boston College 19: In a matchup between the two best running backs in college football Arizona’s Ka’Deem Carey got the best of Boston College’s Andre Williams, rushing for 169 yards and two touchdowns. In Chase Rettig’s final game as an Eagle he passed for 191 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions; with one of the interceptions being returned for a touchdown. Rettig will truly be missed by opposing ACC fans everywhere.</p><p>Texas A&amp;M 52 – Duke 48: In one of, if not the, best non-BCS bowl games of the year, the Blue Devils nearly knocked off Johnny Football and the Aggies in the Chick-fil-A Bowl. The Blue Devils took a 38-17 lead into halftime after running all over a terrible Aggies defense, but Manziel suddenly found a groove and Duke quarterback Anthony Boone threw two late interceptions to sink the Blue Devils. After the game it officially became basketball season and everyone went back to hating Duke, I hope you enjoyed it while it lasted guys.</p><p>Clemson 40 – Ohio State 35: This was the second time in three years the Tigers were one of two ACC teams in a BCS bowl and they were the team in the Orange Bowl. The first time ended in a 70-33 loss to West Virginia, so things turned out a bit better this time. Tigers quarterback Tajh Boyd ended his illustrious career by passing for 378 yards and five touchdowns and rushing for 127 yards and another touchdown. Tigers fans now anxiously wait to see if the program can continue its success of the past three years without him, or if this is just another Matt Ryan and Boston College scenario. Don’t worry Tigers fans, I’m sure new quarterback Rase Chettig will be great.</p><p>Florida State 34 – Auburn 31: It’s fitting that a team from the ACC, described for years as the worst power conference in football, brings the SEC reign of dominance to an end. It’s also fitting that a system that caused so much controversy will forever see its last title in the hands of the ACC. In other words, Florida State’s victory is fitting and the BCS is finally dead. Onwards and upwards to a 2014 filled with the bland, generic “College Football Playoff.” Also, Michael Vick was robbed in the 1999 Heisman voting.</p><p>Well that’s it for this year in ACC football. Altogether it wasn’t the worst year ever, which is the highest compliment you can give the ACC. And on that note, enjoy the offseason and remember, #goacc.</p>

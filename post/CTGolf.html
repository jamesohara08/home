<h1>CT Golf</h1><b>May 01, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Golf is the ultimate individual sport but nobody told the Virginia Tech golf team that.</p><p>“We have five solid players,” said head coach Jay Hardwick, “and they have confidence in each other to play their best.”</p><p>The golf team tied for second last weekend at the ACC Championships, their second best finish ever in the tournament, finishing with a three-day total of 22-under-par 822. They also placed four golfers in the individual top ten of tournament, a feat no other school accomplished.</p><p>Going into the rain soaked final round the team was sitting in fourth place, needing to make up ground.</p><p>“The bad weather was no problem, we’ve dealt with it before and had success,” said Hardwick, “it’s easier to make up shots in bad weather.”</p><p>With his team needing him, the last man on the course, sophomore Trevor Cone, birdied the last four holes in the rain, making him the low scorer for the team on the day and giving the Hokies the best round of the day.</p><p>“We have depth down the line, any one of those guys can be the low scorer on any day,” said Hardwick, “some teams have just one low scorer and when he struggles, they struggle, but that’s not us.”</p><p>“We aren’t a one man team,” said Hardwick, “we put an emphasis on that to recruit top to bottom.&quot;</p><p>Individually, senior Mikey Moyers finished tied for second at ten-under-par 206 in his last ACC Championships. </p><p>“The Navy Spring Invitational was his only finish outside of the top 25, so he had a bit of a chip on his shoulder going into the ACC Championships,” said Hardwick.</p><p>The finish capped off an accomplished career for the senior, who Hardwick pointed to as being a team leader.</p><p>Sophomore Scott Vincent, whose hometown is Harare, Zimbabwe, finished in sixth at six-under-par 210. Vincent finished the season as all-time leading scorer for Virginia Tech.</p><p>Vincent is also the fifth player from Zimbabwe to play for Virginia Tech. Another current player, Marc Macdonald, is also from Harare and the friendship between the two helped them adjust to being at Tech.</p><p>Already the all-time leading scorer, Vincent still has much to accomplish before his collegiate career ends. </p><p>“Despite the success this year we didn’t have a player win an individual title,” said Hardwick, “and I think that’s something Scott could accomplish in the future.”</p><p>All five golfers have dreams of playing professionally after college, but they also recognize that their education is paramount. To that end, Moyers is returning in the fall to graduate, before looking into his pro prospects.</p><p>But they still have a lot of golf to play this season as the NCAA regionals are coming up. The team finds out May 6 whether they will head to Columbus, Ohio; Tallahassee, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Pullman, Washington; Tempe, Arizona or Blessings, Arkansas.</p><p>Regionals takes place from May 16 to May 18 and the top five teams at the regional tournament advance to the national championship.  </p><p>One thing’s for sure though, no matter how far they advance, they will continue to play as a team.</p>

<h1>He Said She Said Spring Start</h1><b>January 23, 2014 Originally published in Collegiate Times with companion She Said</b><p>Many people are thinking it, but I’m going to be the first to explicitly state it. The beginning of the spring semester is much worse than the fall. </p><p>The fall semester starts after about a three month layoff over summer. Those three months are enough to make you forget about the more dreary aspects of school and be excited about the adventures and parties you’ll have.</p><p>Plus, over the summer break it’s hard to meet in person with some of those friends who don’t live near you. The prospect of being able to see and catch up with friends you haven’t seen for three months can outweigh some potential negatives. </p><p>The spring semester starts after just a month of layoff, mostly eaten up by the stressful holiday season. Fall semester is still fresh in your mind and the mistakes you made then still haunt you. </p><p>You just saw your friends too as you were slaving away together during finals week. Nothing new and exciting happened in a month that you want to hear all about. </p><p>Fall semester brings with it Virginia Tech football, games at Lane Stadium and Enter Sandman. There is no other time where you feel more Hokie spirit than when you’re jumping up and down with 66,232 of your fellow Hokies. </p><p>Spring semester brings terrible basketball teams and non-revenue sports. The men’s basketball team hasn’t had an exciting moment since Feb. 26, 2011 and while other sports are great, they just can’t compare to the football team. </p><p>Fall semester begins at the tail end of summer, perfect weather to have a great start to a semester, dorms without air-conditioning aside. Not having to bundle up between each class and actually enjoying the walk are great incentives to not skip. </p><p>The name spring semester is a cruel lie; it begins right in the middle of winter. And with the wind in Blacksburg the way it is, the weather doesn’t pick up until at least April. Classes and cold are a terrible combination. </p><p>However, the worst part of spring semester is that for many, this is when the Virginia Tech experience comes to an end. </p><p>While some do graduate at the after the fall term, a majority do so in May. The feeling of existential dread of what comes next permeates the entire semester while you scramble to make sure you checked everything off that bucket list you wrote before freshmen year. </p><p>Spring semester is just the worst, but since this is my last one, I plan on enjoying every last day of it. </p>

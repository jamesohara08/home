<h1>He Said She Said Goodbye</h1><b>May 01, 2014 Originally published in Collegiate Times with companion She Said</b><p>This is my goodbye column, which is weird to write. I’m on the wrong side of the age curve to be retiring, but all things come to an end and this is mine. </p><p>Every year the end of the spring semester has come quickly, right when the weather really gets nice you’re in the car driving home for the summer. This year though the spring rush is accompanied by panic.</p><p>Over the last few weeks I’ve checked off a number of bucket list items. I hiked Dragon’s Tooth, went to a Salem Red Sox game, reunited with some freshmen year poker buddies for one last game in Slusher and so much more.</p><p>I don’t know what it is about college, but it felt so much faster than high school. Maybe it’s the realization that there are no more definite life steps remaining. The last 21 years have been spent following a well-trodden path, but now there’s no real answer to the question of what’s next. </p><p>I’m lucky enough to have a job right after graduation, but that’s just a small piece of the entire puzzle. I’ve met so many amazing people at Tech and I don’t know how often I’ll see them once we take off in May. </p><p>I’d like to think that I’ll be friends with everyone I know forever, but I’m close enough to my high school graduation to know that’s probably not true. All I can really hope is that they all follow their own amazing paths and that we intersect from time to time. I know they’re all capable of it. </p><p>Compared to most people I’m lucky to even have had this opportunity in the first place and I’d like to think I didn’t waste it, but don’t be surprised if you see me around Blacksburg frantically trying to check off a couple more items on that bucket list. </p><p>Oh, and Samir, I’m going to need my copy of I Am America (And So Can You!) back. </p>

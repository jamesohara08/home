<h1>CT Injury Report</h1><b>August 16, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Looking for a bounce back season after a rough 2012 campaign, the Virginia Tech football team took some bad news on Thursday when head athletic trainer Mike Goforth released an injury update. </p><p>Two key players, offensive lineman Mark Shuman and outside linebacker Ronny Vandyke were ruled out for an extensive period of time. </p><p>Shuman, a possible starter on a volatile offensive line, has a torn lateral meniscus in his right knee and will need surgery to repair it.  According to Goforth, Shuman has torn the meniscus in that knee before in a different spot and will have a four to six week recovery period. Shuman is expected to return in full. </p><p>Vandyke, a likely starter at outside linebacker, has a right shoulder injury that will require surgery. It will keep him out for six to eight months, meaning he will miss the entire 2013 season and is probable for the spring. Vandyke was expected to be a playmaker this year for the Hokies defense. </p><p>Backup running back Tony Gregory has re-torn his left ACL, effectively ending his career. Gregory was unlikely to play a major role in the backfield, however he was a key member of the special teams unit. </p><p>Fellow running back JC Coleman has a left high ankle sprain and a right regular ankle sprain. The Hokies think he’ll be ready for the August 31 game against Alabama, but cautioned that it is an optimistic projection. </p><p>If Coleman is unable to go in Atlanta, the Hokies will be down to just one eligible running back in redshirt freshman Trey Edmunds. Edmunds is currently the co-number one running back on the depth chart with Coleman. </p><p>Offensive lineman Augie Conte has a left ankle sprain, however the Hokies expect him to be able to scrimmage on Saturday or at the very least return in full on Monday. This is good news for an offensive line already lacking enough in depth to move true freshman defensive lineman Wyatt Teller to offensive tackle. </p><p>With just under two weeks to go until the opening game in Atlanta against two-time defending national champion Alabama, the Hokies will be hoping that this is the last bad news out of the trainer’s office. </p>

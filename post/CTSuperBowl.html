<h1>CT Super Bowl</h1><b>February 04, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Seven yards. Only seven yards were between the San Francisco 49ers and one of the, if not the, greatest comeback in Super Bowl history. </p><p>But fate is a fickle mistress, and in four plays the 49ers could only get two yards closer to fulfilling their dream, and their near miraculous 22-point comeback came up short.  The Baltimore Ravens were Super Bowl champions.</p><p>Being a Super Bowl champion is an historical accomplishment in and of itself, but when it comes down to a last minute game-winning drive, or a toppling of an insurmountable lead it just feels more important.</p><p>To wit, four of the last five Super Bowls prior to this one where decided by a last-minute game-winning score and they have been described as some of the best Super Bowls ever. There is just something about that last-minute score that excites fans and creates lasting memories.</p><p>The largest deficit overcome in a Super Bowl is ten points.  This was accomplished twice, in 1988 by the Washington Redskins over the Denver Broncos, and again in 2009 by the New Orleans Saints over the Indianapolis Colts. </p><p>But those aren’t the only momentous comebacks in Super Bowl history.  In 2001 a young Tom Brady lead his New England Patriots to a huge upset over the St. Louis Rams with a last-second drive setting up a walk-off field goal by Adam Vinateri.</p><p>Brady repeated that magic in 2003 when he again led a last-second drive setting up another game-winning Vinateri field goal. In 2007 the New York Giants pulled off another big upset, ending New England’s bid for a perfect record on one of the best drives in NFL history, highlighted by David Tyree catching a deep ball from Eli Manning on his helmet.</p><p>However, the most famous game-winning drive in a Super Bowl was conducted by these same 49ers in 1989 by the legendary Joe Montana. They marched 92-yards in under three minutes to score the game winning touchdown with just 34 seconds left.</p><p>It is a stark contrast. While one 49ers team will go down in NFL history, immortalized forever as “The Drive”, the other has found themselves on the wrong side of history. They aren’t alone there however.</p><p>The 49ers failing right at the doorstep of the end zone is reminiscent of the Tennessee Titans falling a yard short of tying the Super Bowl in 1999.  The image of wide receiver Kevin Dyson stretching the ball out in vain was shown over and over again in the following weeks, much like the no-call on a potential holding call in the end zone at the end of this Super Bowl will be.</p><p>However, as is often said, the history books are written by the victors. The Titans’ last gasp has lost its significance to time, the real story becoming the Greatest Show on Turf, the Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams, and their MVP quarterback Kurt Warner.</p><p>So too, will the 49ers near miraculous comeback be lost in the annals of time. There are certainly things that will be remembered about this Super Bowl: brothers coaching against each other, a power outage during the game, and Jacoby Jones’ record-tying 108 yard kickoff return, but the near comeback won’t be one of them.</p><p>The 49ers had their moment of glory in hand, one of the greatest Super Bowl comebacks of all time, and they let it slip through their grasps.  Just seven yards stopped the 49ers from achieving their dreams.</p>

<h1>CT NCAA</h1><b>April 09, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>The men’s college basketball national championship is returning to its old Kentucky home after the Louisville Cardinals defeated the Michigan Wolverines 82-76 in the national championship game, keeping the title in the state of Kentucky. </p><p>In one of the best title games in recent memory the Wolverines saw their chance at a second national title, just twenty years after the infamous Chris Webber timeout in the 1993 championship game, slip away.</p><p>The Wolverines had a 12 point lead in the first half, but a quick run by Louisville brought the score to 38-37 heading into halftime.</p><p>The second half saw the lead change hands multiple times as there were five lead changes and two ties in the early going before the Cardinals were able to build a tenuous lead and hold on to it until the final buzzer.</p><p>Perhaps the only thing equaling the number of momentum changes was the number of players who took over the game at one point.</p><p>In the first half sparingly used Michigan guard Spike Albrecht exploded for 17 points, making four of five three-pointers and helping the Wolverines build their early lead. With Trey Burke in foul trouble, Albrecht was able to carry the load for the Wolverines.</p><p>Not to be outdone Louisville’s Luke Hancock, the star of their Final Four victory over Wichita State, went on a run of his own. Hancock scored 14 points in just 2:34, making four three-pointers in that span. Hancock finished the game with 22 points and the award for the Most Outstanding Player in the Final Four.</p><p>In the second half the stars took over as Michigan’s Trey Burke and Louisville’s Peyton Siva scored 17 and 14 of their respective points in the second half. Burke, the Wooden Award winner for the nation’s top player, led the Wolverines with 24 points, but it was Siva who was celebrating at the end of the night.</p><p>One of the best moments of the tournament came after the game though. Louisville guard Kevin Ware, who suffered a gruesome knee injury in the Cardinals’ Elite Eight victory, was able to help cut down the nets in Atlanta after the Cardinals’ win.  After the injury Ware had become a motivating factor for the Cardinals and could be seen cheering on his teammates in Atlanta, still in uniform.</p><p>The victory also capped off an incredible week for Louisville coach Rick Pitino.  Earlier Monday, Pitino was introduced as the newest member of the basketball Hall of Fame.  On Saturday, a horse he co-owned won the Santa Anita Derby and became a favorite to win the Kentucky Derby.  And last week his son became the head coach at Minnesota.</p><p>Pitino won his second national championship as a coach. His first came with the other Kentucky school, when he won it all with the Wildcats in 1996. It was Louisville’s third national title and the school’s first since 1986, the second longest title drought for a school with multiple title victories.</p><p>Despite the loss the Wolverines had an excellent season. They also pulled off the best comeback in the tournament in the Sweet Sixteen when they rallied from 14 points down in the second half to beat Kansas. </p><p>But it was Louisville cutting down the nets in Atlanta. In a tournament fraught with upsets and Cinderellas, the overall top seed Cardinals navigated their way through the danger and to the national title.</p>

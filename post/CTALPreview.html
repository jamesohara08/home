<h1>CT AL Preview</h1><b>March 26, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>The American League is in a state of transition. In previous years the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox used their vast resources to dominate the league, but that is not true anymore.</p><p>The American League is more balanced than ever before and the power lies elsewhere, even in the Yankees and Red Sox own division.</p><p>The favorite to take the AL East crown this season is the Toronto Blue Jays. Long the third or fourth best team in the East, the Blue Jays saw the opportunity presented by the decline of the Yankees and Red Sox and pounced.</p><p>Taking advantage of yet another fire sale by the Miami Marlins the Blue Jays were able to obtain Jose Reyes, Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle and Emilio Bonifacio to add to their collection of talent. Toss in a trade for NL Cy Young winner R.A. Dickey and the Blue Jays look like an entirely different team.</p><p>However, the AL East will be tough as the remaining four teams all still have legitimate chances at reaching the playoffs.</p><p>The Tampa Bay Rays did not make any additions in the offseason and lost top starter James Shields and center fielder BJ Upton. But the Rays have been one of the best at finding cheap talent and doing more with less, so they shouldn’t be discounted.</p><p>The Yankees and Red Sox both still have some big names on their teams like Derek Jeter and David Ortiz. However, both also have far too many players on the wrong side of 30 and the Yankees in particular have some serious injury issues already.</p><p>Finally, last season’s big surprise team the Baltimore Orioles, who come back with nearly the exact same team. Last year the Orioles outperformed their talent though, getting significant playing time from wash-ups like Nate McLouth and Lew Ford, but that could just be proof of Orioles Magic.</p><p>In the AL Central the runaway favorite is the Detroit Tigers who boast back-to-back AL MVPs and Triple Crown winners in Justin Verlander and Miguel Cabrera. Add some more star power in Prince Fielder, Austin Jackson, Victor Martinez and Torii Hunter and it’s no wonder why they are a popular World Series pick.</p><p>It also helps the Tigers that the rest of the Central ranges from possibly decent to a disaster. The Tigers only real competition, if you can call it that, will likely come from the Cleveland Indians. </p><p>The Indians signed outfielders Nick Swisher and Michael Bourn which will get them a pretty good lineup. However their pitching is still lacking, with wash-up Scott Kazmir attempting to make a comeback as their fifth starter.</p><p>The Chicago White Sox always seem to outperform expectations, but it will be much harder to do so this season. With aging stars and no offseason moves to fill gaps, the White Sox will be fighting to get to .500.</p><p>After the Kansas City Royals traded for James Shields and Wade Davis some dubbed them as a dark horse candidate to make the playoffs. But the Royals are still the Royals and any team that starts Jeff Francoeur should not be taken seriously.</p><p>Finally, the Minnesota Twins will be making a run at the worst record in the history of baseball. </p><p>In the AL West the Oakland A’s shocked everyone last season by taking the division over the heavily favored Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Angels. This season the Rangers and Angels will be favored again, but don’t count out those A’s.</p><p>The Angels made the big splash this offseason by signing former Rangers’ star outfielder Josh Hamilton away. With Mike Trout at the top of the order and Albert Pujols and Hamilton manning the 3-4 spots this team should score an abundance of runs. While CJ Wilson and Jered Weaver will headline the pitching staff.</p><p>The Rangers have fallen off a bit after going to two straight World Series in 2010 and 2011. Still, they have great pitching, good hitting and one of the best prospects in the game in Jurickson Profar. Japanese import Yu Darvish is an early favorite for Cy Young and can lead this team back to the postseason.</p><p>The Athletics bring back the same young core that made that miraculous run to the playoffs last year, while adding Japanese shortstop Hiroyuki Nakajima. Cuban star Yoenis Cespedes should continue to murder baseballs and the young rotation can keep the A’s in nearly every game.</p><p>After the superb top three in the West there is a significant drop off to the last two teams. The Seattle Mariners still have Felix Hernandez, while the Houston Astros moved to the AL West from the NL Central. </p>

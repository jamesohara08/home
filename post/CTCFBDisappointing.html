<h1>CT CFB Disappointing</h1><b>November 27, 2012 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>On August 27<sup>th</sup> USC, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Michigan State, Virginia Tech, and Auburn were all ranked in at least one poll, and holding aspirations of making it to a BCS bowl, maybe even the National Championship Game.  Today, none of these teams are ranked, and only Wisconsin has a shot at a BCS bowl due to ineligible teams ahead of them.</p><p>The most disappointing is probably the USC Trojans.  No school who had been ranked preseason number one in the AP Poll had lost 5 games that year since Mississippi in 1964 until the Trojans accomplished that feat this year.  </p><p>Loaded on offense with preseason Heisman hopeful and presumptive top NFL draft pick quarterback Matt Barkley, Penn State transfer running back Silas Redd, and NFL caliber receivers Robert Woods and Marquis Lee, as well as a talented defense, USC looked well on their way to another national championship.</p><p>However Barkley struggled mightily, and that combined with a defense who had trouble stopping top teams and a stronger than predicted Pac-12, USC found themselves 7-5 with a trip to the Sun Bowl booked.</p><p>After trips to the Sugar Bowl and Cotton Bowl along with a top 5 finish the previous season the Arkansas Razorbacks looked poised to make another trip to a big time bowl.</p><p>But after a week 2 loss to Louisiana-Monroe on their home field and then an injury to star quarterback Tyler Wilson, things started to go downhill fast and the Razorbacks found themselves with a 4-8 record, with two of those wins coming over Jacksonville State and Tulane.</p><p>Also in the SEC the Auburn Tigers were the lowest ranked of these six teams, but was still considered a dark horse candidate to win the tough SEC West.  Coach Gene Chizik was just two years removed from winning the national championship, and the Tigers had some talented recruits coming in.</p><p>The Tigers went on instead to have the worst season in school history, finishing 0-8 in the SEC for the first time ever.   Auburn finished the season with only 3 wins -- over Louisiana-Monroe in overtime, New Mexico State, and Alabama A&amp;M, and no fan support.  Chizik was fired at the end of the season, the fastest time a coach lost his job after winning the national championship.</p><p>The Wisconsin Badgers and Michigan State Spartans tied for the Big Ten championship 2 years ago, and competed in the first ever Big Ten championship game last season.  Many believed these two teams would clash again for the title in 2012.</p><p>For a second year the Badgers used the graduate school transfer rule to bring in a top ACC quarterback, this time former freshman sensation Danny O’Brien from Maryland.  However O’Brien couldn’t live up to the expectations set the previous year by Russell Wilson, starting only 3 games before being benched. </p><p>The Badgers never really got going, finishing 7-5, but made the Big 10 title game anyways due to Ohio State and Penn State being ineligible to participate in the game.</p><p>Meanwhile the Spartans lost star quarterback Kirk Couisins to the NFL, and their hopes rested on star running back Le’Veon Bell, who after a stunning week one performance against Boise State seemed like a Heisman frontrunner.</p><p>While Bell still had a fairly successful season he was the only player on the team who did, and the Spartans found themselves at 6-6 finishing 109<sup>th</sup> in the nation in scoring.</p><p>Finally, the hometown Hokies started the season expecting to compete for a trip to a BCS bowl for a third consecutive year. Quarterback Logan Thomas was considered by many to have first round draft pick potential, and a dark horse for the Heisman.  Meanwhile the defense, returning 9 starters, was expected to be in a class with the 2006 unit as the best in team history.</p><p>In reality, Thomas was never able to get into rhythm, finishing the season with only 3 more touchdown passes –17, than interceptions – 14. The defense was gashed by an awful Pittsburgh team and set records for futility against North Carolina, while also giving up game winning drives with less than 2 minutes to both Cincinnati and Florida State.</p><p>The Hokies finished 6-6 and could end up in the Sun Bowl with those USC Trojans.  Perhaps the NCAA can rename it the Disappointment Bowl for this season.</p>

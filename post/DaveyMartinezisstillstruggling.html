<h1>Davey Martinez is still struggling</h1><b>April 10, 2019</b><p>The Nats had a hopefully key comeback win last night against the Phillies that featured some excellent middle relief and awesome moments from our two young stars. However, I would be remiss if I let a moment that perfectly encapsulates a lot of what Nats fans hate about Davey Martinez go by without comment. Let’s walk through that whole ninth inning to get an idea about the basic mistakes Martinez is making in handling his relievers and how that can domino into bigger problems.</p><p>To start, let’s assess the bullpen situation at the start of the ninth inning. The Nats have eight relievers right now and have already used two: Joe Ross and Matt Grace. Another pair should be rested: Justin Miller has had high pitch counts four of the last six days and Wander Suero has pitched three days in a row (albeit two were short appearances). Trevor Rosenthal is also unavailable due to his suckitis. That leaves us Kyle Barraclough, Tony Sipp and Sean Doolittle.</p><p>The Nats are down one run in the top of the ninth, one of three things can happen here: </p><ol><li>The Nats don’t score and the game is over</li><li>The Nats score one run to tie the game and head to the bottom of the ninth needing to keep it tied or else the game is over</li><li>The Nats score multiple runs and lead the game heading to the bottom of the ninth</li></ol><p>The Phillies will have the top of their order batting in the bottom of the ninth if the game comes to it, which means only one pitcher should be warming up right now: Doolittle. Because either you’ll need him to get the save or you’ll need him to keep the game tied against the Phillies’ best hitters or the game has ended and you lost. This is especially important because the Nats bullpen has already blown a couple games and you can imagine the huge emotional impact if the Nats come all the way back from a 6-1 deficit just to watch their bullpen immediately blow the game. You need Sean Doolittle here.</p><p>Instead, Martinez has both Doolittle and Barraclough getting warm when there is no situation where you want to use Barraclough.</p><p>It should be noted here that relievers abhor warming up for a game they never enter. They gave it the vulgar nickname dry humping, because their arms get fatigued just as much as if they’d entered the game, but they get no value from it. Players commonly complained about Matt Williams doing this and complained about Martinez doing it to start last season.</p><p>Moving on, Victor Robles ties the game with a great home run but that’s it. Tie game, in comes Doolittle right? Wrong. Instead, Barraclough is entering the game. Already this is a mistake, but then Martinez shows why it was extremely stupid as he gets Sipp and Doolittle (both lefties) warming up in the pen simultaneously. Why? Because he doesn’t trust Barraclough to face Bryce Harper, who, mind you, is due up third, so it’s not like this is a sudden surprise. So at best, Barraclough did a full warmup to come into a tie game and get two batters out before giving way to Sipp or Doolittle. At worse, Barraclough gives up a homer and the game is over without your one good reliever ever pitching in it. Barraclough gives us an at medium, he puts one batter on, but gets one out.</p><p>All right so we’ve already burned Barraclough for no reason, making him warmup and enter a game he shouldn’t have needed to while also shortening our already short bullpen in a tie game that could potentially go deep into extra innings. But wait, why was Tony Sipp warming up? In what situation would he have ever come into the game here? Maybe if Barraclough had gotten the first two outs you could use Sipp instead of Doolittle to make Harper the third out. But Harper could just as easily hit a home run to end the game, two outs or not. And what happens if Harper just reaches base, are you really going to let Sipp face the right handed Rhys Hoskins? You shouldn’t, which would require Doolittle entering the game anyways and using three (!!) relievers to finish one inning in a tie game. There’s even less of a reason to use Sipp here than there was to start the inning with Barraclough. We’ve now dry humped one reliever and quickied another.</p><p>With a runner on, Martinez finally brings in Doolittle to face Harper, a much more stressful situation than just having Doolittle start the inning against McCutchen. Luckily Doolittle is a very good pitcher and he manages to get out of the inning with the game still tied. Martinez then gets lucky as the Nats hang four runs on the Phillies in the top of the 10th to win it, with Doolittle finishing out the 10th.</p><p>However, it’s probably worth a moment to explore what Martinez would’ve done if the game kept going. Presumably Doolittle would’ve pitched the bottom of the 10th like he did, but then who is pitching the 11th inning? A LOOGY in Sipp or a tired Miller or Suero? How good do you feel about the Nats not giving up a run in that situation? </p><p>It would have been better to have Doolittle start the ninth and then pitch the 10th (he essentially threw the same amount of pitches this would take), then have Barraclough ready to go for the 11th (against the bottom of the order) and maybe 12th inning if it came to that. You’ve now gotten two extra innings before hitting the break glass in case of emergency moment. </p><p>Now, finally we’ll look at those domino effects I was talking about earlier. Today’s starter is Jeremy Hellickson who pretty famously wasn’t allowed to pitch a third time through the order last season which limits him to at best six and most likely five innings. That’s another longish day for the bullpen. With Ross, Grace and Doolittle all throwing two innings last night they likely shouldn’t pitch again today. That leaves us with Miller and Suero coming off their one day of rest and Barraclough and Sipp who could’ve been very fresh with a day off last night, but instead both got action either warming up or in the game. Rosenthal, again, doesn’t count. </p><p>If Martinez had gone with Doolittle to start the ninth and the game played out the same otherwise Sipp and Barraclough never even warm up. Putting extra mileage on Barraclough and Sipp’s arms last night has now set them up to be gassed during a game they’ll be required for today, putting the team in a worse spot and increasing their chances of injury due to fatigue. The off-day Thursday can help everyone, but what would really help would be a manager with better foresight.</p>

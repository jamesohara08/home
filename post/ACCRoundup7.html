<h1>ACC Roundup 7</h1><b>October 16, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>The ACC has four teams in the national top 20. Meanwhile, the Triangle is a combined 0-7 in league play. Chin up boys, it’s nearly roundyball time. This is your ACC Roundup. </p><p>Clemson 24 – Boston College 14: After losing to then-number eight Florida State by only 14 earlier this season, the Eagles again played a top 10 opponent close. The Eagles moved to 1-2 in conference, but they’re 2-0 in moral victories. The Tigers meanwhile weren’t upset heading into the biggest ACC game in a decade on a weekend where three other undefeated teams lost, which is an upset in itself. </p><p>Maryland 27 – Virginia 26: For the second year in a row the Terrapins defeated the Cavaliers with a back-up quarterback, although this time it wasn’t a converted linebacker. With the Terrapins taking their talents to the Big Ten, this could be the final matchup for a game that has been played annually since 1957. Realignment is sad. </p><p>Duke 35 – Navy 7: Starting quarterback Anthony Boone returned after a three game absence to save the Blue Devils and lead them to the promised land, which just goes to show that every story is an allusion to the Bible. The Midshipmen’s seven points were the fewest scored by an FBS team against the Blue Devils since 2008, so it might’ve been better if the federal government shutdown had prevented them from playing. </p><p>BYU 38 – Georgia Tech 20: The Yellow Jackets lost by 18 to a team that Virginia beat by three in the first week of the season, so that’s probably not a good sign for the Ramblin’ Wreck. It also shows how much of a mess this conference is after you get past the top four. If you see a Virginia – Georgia Tech game walking down the street towards you, quickly avert your glare and cross the street to a Miami – Florida State matchup instead.</p><p>Syracuse 24 – North Carolina State 10: The Orange had two running backs rush for over 100 yards en route to their first ACC road victory. On the other sideline, the Wolfpack could only muster 355 total yards of offense, seven short of the Orange’s total rushing yards. This is a game nobody will probably remember even occurred two weeks from now, which is a reminder of the fragility of life and our impending mortality. </p><p>And on that note, #goacc. </p>

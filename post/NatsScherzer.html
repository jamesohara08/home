<h1>Nats Scherzer</h1><b>January 19, 2015</b><p>Yesterday the Washington Nationals pulled off a stunner by signing top free agent starting pitcher Max Scherzer. The details of the contract are still unclear, but it’s believed to be a seven year deal. The deal is primarily one for the Nationals long term success. It adds Scherzer to Ryan Zimmerman, Bryce Harper, Anthony Rendon, Gio Gonzalez and Tanner Roark as notable Nats with at least four years of team control left. Giving the Nationals a solid core to build around as their roster turns over the next couple years. </p><p>However, it also gives them a good deal of value in the present. Scherzer is one of the best pitchers in the game right now and the Nationals already have a few of those of their own. Adding Scherzer to an already formidable rotation seems like overkill. And while the Nationals could use the flexibility to deal a starting pitcher for needed value elsewhere, for now they have what appears to be on paper, the best starting rotation in baseball.</p><p>Last season, five of the current Nationals were in the top 30 among qualified starters in ERA-, which is ERA adjusted for park and league: Doug Fister (No. 8), Jordan Zimmermann (No. 12), Roark (No. 17), Scherzer (No. 21) and Stephen Strasburg (No. 27). That’s the most such starters in MLB, with the next best team being the White Sox with three. By FIP-, which is Fielding Independent Pitching adjusted for park and league, the Nats had three starters in the top 30: Zimmermann (No. 6), Scherzer (No. 10) and Strasburg (No. 13). That ties them with the Dodgers and White Sox for the most such starters in MLB.</p><p>However, past success does not always guarantee future success. So to get a better idea of what to expect from the Nats in 2015 we turn to FanGraphs’ Depth Charts, which combines Steamer and ZiPS projections with educated playing time estimates to project a player’s value for the coming season. The individual projections can then be combined to make a team estimate. Projections aren’t gospel, but they’re usually fairly accurate. </p><p>To start the Nationals are second behind the Dodgers in projected team ERA at 3.41. What’s noticeable is the sizeable gap between the Dodgers and the Nationals and then between the Nationals and next best squads, the Giants, Cardinals and Mariners. The Nationals aren’t the only team that spent this offseason building up a strong starting rotation as the Dodgers added Brandon McCarthy and Brett Anderson to the back of their rotation.</p><p>By the slightly more advanced FIP, the Nationals again rank second behind the Dodgers, but not by much. And this time there’s an even larger gap between the Nationals and Dodgers and the other three top five teams. </p><p>Finally, by overall starting pitcher wins above replacement, the Nationals rotation’s strength shines, its depth. While the Dodgers overall numbers are enhanced greatly by having the best pitcher in the game in Clayton Kershaw, the back end of their rotation just can’t compare to what the Nationals have. One through five the Nationals rotation is better on paper than any in the game and it isn’t particularly close, with them coming out nearly a full win ahead of the Dodgers. And with Tanner Roark as insurance the Nationals won’t suffer all that much if the injury bug strikes, giving them key depth that few other teams have. </p><p>The Nationals already had a great rotation, before the signing their FanGraphs projected WAR was 12.6 wins, just a tick below the Dodgers. Now they have a chance at being a historically great rotation and at the least a good chance at being the best in baseball. </p>

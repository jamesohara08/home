<h1>Game #18 Recap: Nats Fall 2-0 in Rubber Match at New York</h1><b>April 21, 2013</b><div class="entry-content">
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals got a glimpse of the future with top prospect<br/>
Anthony Rendon making his Major League debut at third base to fill in for an<br/>
injured Ryan Zimmerman. However, their early season struggles continued as they<br/>
were shut out by the Mets, losing 2-0, to drop the rubber-match.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jordan Zimmermann got the start for the Nationals, looking<br/>
to extend his record to 4-0. But Zimmermann struggled with his normally impeccable<br/>
control, walking three and only getting through five innings on 96 pitches.<br/>
Zimmermann still managed to be effective, limiting the Mets to only two runs on<br/>
two hits and four strikeouts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Zimmermann gave up his first run in the second inning when<br/>
he gave up a solo shot to John Buck. Buck, who has been red hot to start the<br/>
year, deposited a 2-2 fastball into the upper deck in left field. The second<br/>
run came on a sacrifice fly from Mike Baxter, allowing David Wright to score<br/>
from third.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Zimmermann’s counterpart, Dillon Gee, had his best start of<br/>
the season so far. Gee cruised through his first five innings only allowing<br/>
just three base runners. Gee fell apart in the sixth inning, getting just two<br/>
outs around three walks and a wild pitch. After the third walk Gee’s day was<br/>
done, shutting out the Nationals for 5.2 innings, allowing just three hits and<br/>
striking out six.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After Zimmermann exited, Zach Duke came in to the game and<br/>
was superb. Duke held down the Mets offense for the next two innings, allowing<br/>
just two hits on four strikeouts. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals threatened in the top of the eighth when Steve<br/>
Lombardozzi and Denard Span got on base to lead off the inning. However, after<br/>
getting ahead 3-0, Jayson Werth made a curious choice to swing away and<br/>
grounded into a double play. Bryce Harper then struck out to end the inning and<br/>
the Nationals’ best chance to score all day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Henry Rodriguez came out for the bottom of the eighth and<br/>
got a quick 1-2-3, striking out Ike Davis and Lucas Duda, continuing a streak<br/>
of effective innings this season by the embattled reliever. Rodriguez looked<br/>
particularly in control today, moving with a quicker pace and locating his<br/>
pitches well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals couldn’t get anything going in the ninth<br/>
inning. Rendon got one last shot to get a hit in his debut, but struck out to<br/>
end the game. Bobby Parnell earned the save for the Mets.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals finished their six game road trip going 3-3<br/>
against the Marlins and Mets. They return home tomorrow to face the St. Louis<br/>
Cardinals for the first time since their NLDS match-up last year.</p>

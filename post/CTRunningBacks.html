<h1>CT Running Backs</h1><b>August 29, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Heading into the 2013 offseason it looked like the Virginia Tech football team would have its hands full trying to sort out their running backs.  Both starters from 2012 – JC Coleman and Michael Holmes- were back along with main backup Tony Gregory and redshirt freshmen Trey Edmunds and Chris Mangus. </p><p>Heading into the season opener against Alabama it seems likely that only one of those running backs, Trey Edmunds, will be playing. What was once their deepest position on offense is now their shallowest. </p><p>The attrition began in July, when Holmes was dismissed from Virginia Tech by a student judicial board after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault and battery charge in June. The Hokies then lost another running back when Gregory re-tore his ACL, effectively ending his career at Virginia Tech. </p><p>In fall practice another change occurred when Mangus changed positions to wide receiver, while highly rated 2012 recruit Joel Caleb moved over to running back. Caleb took to the position quickly and he is now listed as the second team running back on the depth chart. </p><p>However, Caleb has been suspended for the season opener against Alabama because of an unspecified violation of team rules. </p><p>There was more bad news for the Hokie running backs though. When the training staff announced Gregory’s injury, they also announced that Coleman had sprained both his right and left ankle. At the time they gave an optimistic projection that he would be ready for Alabama, however the latest injury report listed him as questionable. </p><p>When asked about Coleman’s status on Tuesday running backs coach Shane Beamer said, “He looked better. I’ll be honest with you at about 12 noon today I didn’t think there was any chance he would play. He said he feels good.”</p><p>Only having one running back definitely available is worrying though and the Hokies would rather not have one player take all of the carries. </p><p>“I don’t think it’s realistic against these guys, or any game, to ask Trey Edmunds to take the entire game,” said Beamer. </p><p>To help combat the depth issues the Hokies moved Chris Mangus back to running back for the time being. With Caleb unavailable, if Coleman cannot go on Saturday Mangus will be the backup to Edmunds.</p><p>“Now we’ll have packages where Mangus will have to get in the game,” said Beamer.</p><p>To his credit Edmunds seems willing to take on the challenge. “Football is a contact sport. Being a running back the contact is definitely going to come,” said Edmunds. </p><p>“The thing is to have each and every guy ready so when one guy goes down we have other guys ready and that’s why myself and some of the other running backs were able to step up,” said Edmunds.</p><p>Going into a big game against the consensus number one team in the nation in Alabama, especially with just one healthy full-time running back, can be daunting and the Hokie aren’t pretending otherwise. </p><p>“They are really good, but they are really good fundamentally,” said Beamer. </p><p>“It’s definitely going to be big. I haven’t really set to many personal goals but from a team aspect it’s definitely going to be big,” said Edmunds. </p><p>After the injury report released Thursday night the Hokies should have a better idea of Coleman’s availability for Saturday. In any case, the running backs will be relied upon to step up against a daunting opponent. </p><p>“I just want us to play hard. Hopefully we can get everything to click,” said Edmunds. </p>

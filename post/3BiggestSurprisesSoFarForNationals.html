<h1>3 Biggest Surprises So Far For Nationals</h1><b>May 06, 2012</b><p>3 Biggest Surprises So Far For Nationals</p><p>1) The Record</p><p>Now this might seem like an easy one but if I had told even the most optimistic Nats fan before the season that the Nationals would start out 18-9 and be tied for the best record in the National League they would call me crazy.  And yet here we are, first in the NL East for a majority of the season, and one of the top teams in the Majors so far, despite having a 5 game losing streak at the end of April.  The Nationals have won 8 of 9 series so far, including against thought to be possible playoff teams in the Reds, Marlins, Diamondbacks, and Phillies.  While pennants are not won in April a great start is still helpful, and the Nationals have gotten off to an outstanding one.</p><p>2) The Rotation</p><p>While the rotation received much of the preseason hype and was expected to be one of the better ones in baseball, the start they have gotten off to is unbelievable. The rotation as a whole is first in MLB in the following categories: ERA (2.09), Quality Starts (21), Earned Runs (39), Batting Average Against (.193), and Hits allowed (116).  They are also fourth in walks (40) and third in strikeouts (151), placing them not only as one of the best rotations right now, but in the history of baseball so far.  Now these numbers probably will not continue to be as historically great, but they should still be one of the best rotations in all of baseball not just this year but for years to come.</p><p>3) The Bench</p><p>Out of this list this is probably the least talked about improvement for the Nats, but it certainly is a surprise compared to past Nationals benches.  Nationals players already have eight RBIs as a pinch hitter, just six less than they had all of last season.  Nationals pinch hitters are top 15 in hits, RBIs, OPS, and Runs, giving the Nats quality contributions from what is termed the “Goon Squad”.  In addition fill-in jobs by Steve Lombardozzi and Chad Tracy for injured stars Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Laroche respectively, have been excellent, keeping the Nationals from falling apart after losing two of their better players.  A sign of a great team is the level of depth they have, and so far the Nats have proven that this is no longer as big of a problem as it used to be for them.</p>

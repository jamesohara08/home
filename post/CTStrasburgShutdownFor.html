<h1>CT Strasburg Shutdown For</h1><b>August 28, 2012 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>For most Washington Nationals fans a column on why Stephen Strasburg should be shutdown should be just one line long.</p><p>Because medical experts say so.</p><p>There are no other factors to take into consideration.  Sure the Nats current position in first place in the NL East and a near lock for the playoffs is a temptation.  But the only real factor is what is best for the health of Stephen Strasburg.  And all of the medical experts the Nationals have talked to say that what’s best for Strasburg is an innings limit.</p><p>Yes, despite what some may think Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo did not just wake up one morning and decide he was going to arbitrarily stop Strasburg from pitching just for fun.  This decision was reached with heavy consultation from the doctor whom performed the surgery, Dr. Lewis Yocum, as well as data from numerous studies provided by both Strasburg’s agent Scott Boras and other independent researchers.  </p><p>In these expert’s opinions not only does Strasburg need to take it slow due to the Tommy John surgery, but he is also, at the age of 23, still in a developmental phase for a pitcher.  One in which if he throws too much likely could give him injury or performance issues down the road.  From these opinions Rizzo then formed the plan for Strasburg that is coming to fruition now:  pitch him regularly until he reaches an area where issues become much more statistically probable and then shut him down.</p><p>And this isn’t just the opinion of the experts the Nationals consulted either.  In an <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8253442/shut-stephen-strasburg-just-let-pitch">article</a> by ESPN’s Jayson Stark multiple independent medical experts, including two doctors who learned from renowned sports physician Dr. James Andrews, were teeming with excitement over the fact that a professional team has decided to take their advice.  One expert, Stan Conte the Dodgers’ senior director of medical services, was quoted comparing this decision to the groundbreaking Moneyball draft of the 2001 Oakland A’s which was such a game changer the story was just turned into a movie starring Brad Pitt. </p><p>Now will this move guarantee that Stephen Strasburg will pitch until he’s 43 without ever getting so much as a hangnail? No of course not, but just because it isn’t 100% does not mean it is not helpful. There are 49 other numbers between 50 and 100, any of which would give a better chance for success if shut down than if not.  In addition, this is not about keeping Strasburg healthy in some unforeseen future, it is about keeping him healthy now, so he can be a part of said future. If he keeps throwing he will be in a dangerous spot for developing an injury or just basic arm fatigue which could plague him for the rest of his career. Is there a chance that won’t happen? Of course but according to everything that is currently known on the subject there is a better chance that it will and the Nationals are doing the smart thing by taking that better chance.</p><p>All of this is to say that the old school baseball theory that says to just pitch guys as often and as long as possible that many analysts or players are basing their analysis on is not correct.  Being the macho man who toughs it out makes a great story depending on where you end it, often that is before the downside appears. Every sports medical professional asked has said in one way or another that what the Nationals are doing with Strasburg is the correct decision for both the player and the team. Therefore shutting down Strasburg is the best move the Nationals can make.</p>

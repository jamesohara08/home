<h1>Blake Treinen</h1><b>January 31, 2015</b><p>Blake Treinen, nicknamed Ziggy Stardust by my dad for his uncanny similarity to David Bowie, is a man of mystery for the 2015 Nationals. After coming over in the Michael Morse trade that also netted A.J. Cole and Ian Krol, not much thought was given to the 6’ 5” fireballer. But last season Treinen proved to be a valuable depth piece, starting seven games as an injury replacement, throwing 36 innings for a 3.00 ERA. In 2015 Treinen and his up to 98 mile per hour sinker could serve as rotation depth again or he could be called upon to take up a spot in the back end of a Nationals bullpen that no longer has Rafael Soriano and Tyler Clippard.</p><p>With the signing of veteran reliever Casey Janssen along with starter Max Scherzer it would appear that the Nats bullpen is full for now with Drew Storen, Janssen, Craig Stammen, Aaron Barrett, Matt Thornton, Jerry Blevins and Tanner Roark. However, bullpens are never that easy and should never be written in stone. If the Nats believe Treinen would be an upgrade over one of the aforementioned in spring they won’t hesitate to put him in the pen instead, like last spring when Barrett beat out the more established Ryan Mattheus. </p><p>The more likely place for Treinen is at AAA Syracuse as a starter, where he can then provide injury insurance for both the rotation and the bullpen. While he did well in his short stints in the Majors last season there is no guarantee that he can perform to that level in the future. For the long term while he has a killer fastball, his secondary offerings still need a lot of work. In his time in MLB he threw 79.5 percent fastballs, which won’t be enough to be a full time Major League starting pitcher. More time in AAA could help him work more on his secondary pitches, but more likely his best case is as a reliever where he can get by with one killer pitch. </p><p>Treinen will likely throw some innings with the Nationals in 2015 as he starts the year at the top of the depth chart for bullpen replacements and second behind Roark for starting replacements. And when he does hit the mound, be sure to play some Bowie, legend has it that it syncs up perfectly to Treinen’s outings. </p>

<h1>Virginia Tech</h1><b>September 02, 2011</b><p>Tomorrow afternoon the Virginia Tech Hokies football team kicks off their 2011 campaign against the Appalachian State Mountaineers and as a card carrying member of Hokie Nation I’m here to give you a full rundown on what to expect from one of the ACC’s premier teams.</p><p>Offense – The offense this year is dealing in extremes as parts of this year’s unit have a multitude of experience, while others, most notably the quarterback position, is on the complete other side of the spectrum.  Because of the departure of 2010 ACC Player of the Year and winningest quarterback in Tech history Tyrod Taylor to the Baltimore Ravens the Hokies are now breaking in redshirt Sophomore Logan Thomas at quarterback.  Thomas at 6’6 and 254 pounds is an athletic freak and extremely talented, but that does not mean he will not deal with some struggles as he gets used to the college game. Luckily for Thomas, the Hokies will have 4 5<sup>th</sup> year Seniors starting on the offensive line and four talented receivers with game day experience in Jarrett Boykin, Danny Coale, Marcus Davis, and Dyrell Roberts.  But perhaps the most exciting part of the Hokies offense this year will be Junior running back David Wilson.  Wilson, who had 1,437 all-purpose yards and 11 touchdowns, will become the feature back this year after splitting carries with Ryan Williams and Darren Evans, and has the electric speed and moves to become one of the top backs in the nation.</p><p>Defense – The defense starts with middle linebacker Bruce Taylor who brings both the leadership and natural skills to anchor a unit that has been consistently strong under Bud Foster’s time at Tech.  But the real strength of this unit may be in the secondary where pre-season All-American cornerback Jayron Hosely is joined by skilled corner Kyle Fuller and safeties Eddie Whitley and Antone Exum who spent the offseason learning each other’s position as well as improving at their own.  The key to the defense this year will be redshirt Junior Whip linebacker Jeron Gouveia-Winslow, who struggled often last year leading to the Foster having to often resort to nickel packages, if Gouveia-Winslow can perform up to his abilities, and consistently at that, the Hokies should be a tough team to score on.</p><p>Special Teams- It is well known that Beamer Ball stresses that special teams is as important as offense and defense, and the Hokies have some playmakers in the return positions.  David Wilson returns as the kick returner where he had two returns for touchdowns that were the key to wins over N.C. State and Georgia Tech.  In addition Jayron Hosely will be back returning punts for Tech, where he is always a danger to take one to the house.  As they have for the past couple of years the Hokies will be breaking in a new kicker in redshirt Sophomore Cody Journell.  Perhaps the most worrying is the punter position, where receiver Danny Coale had a legitimate shot to play before Scott Delmer was able to beat him out for the job.</p><p>X-Factor – The only thing that could potentially hold this team back is depth.  Especially on the offensive and defensive lines, where the Hokies cannot afford to lose anyone as they have three true freshmen in back-up roles.  Tech will be dressing 24 players who have never played in a college football game before, which while necessarily does not mean they will be bad, inexperience often kills good college teams.</p><p>Predictions-  With the Hokies incredibly easy schedule in mind, they are the only BCS school who have no non-conference games against a BCS opponent and no games on their schedule against preseason top 25 teams, an undefeated season is not out of the question.  Their real test will most likely come against a talented Florida State team in the ACC Championship game, which if all goes right for both teams could be for a spot in the BCS National Championship.  The homer in me would like to say they win that game and go on to take the first National Championship in the team’s history.  However I feel it is much more likely that they stumble at some point in their ACC schedule and drop the ACC championship game to the Seminoles, but still go on to win the Chik-Fil-A bowl to finish 11-2, which would be more than respectable for a team breaking in a new quarterback.</p>

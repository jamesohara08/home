<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals hit the road tonight to face the Cincinnati<br/>
Reds and found out just how cozy the confines of Great American Ballpark are.<br/>
The Reds’ home stadium is known to be an extreme hitter’s park and tonight that<br/>
benefited the Reds, as they blasted six home runs, three just over the wall, to<br/>
bury the Nats 15-0.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The star of the night was the Reds’ young shortstop Zack<br/>
Cozart. Cozart got ahold of a Dan Haren first-pitch fastball and dumped it into<br/>
the left field stands in the second inning; the latter half of back-to-back home<br/>
runs started by Todd Frazier. Cozart got to Haren again in the third inning,<br/>
sending another ball into the left field stands, this time a three-run homer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A Shin-Soo Choo home run, Cozart sac fly, Jay Bruce double, another<br/>
Frazier home run, an Xavier Paul grand slam and Frazier single all tacked on additional runs<br/>
in a game that got away from the Nats quickly and they never really got back<br/>
into.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Haren struggled mightily in his Nationals’ debut throwing 78<br/>
pitches in four ineffective innings. Haren finished his night having allowed<br/>
nine hits, six earned runs and four home runs. Zach Duke then made his season<br/>
debut as the long reliever throwing two and two-thirds innings and giving up<br/>
four more runs. The Nats then took the opportunity to get Henry Rodriguez some work, while Ryan Mattheus finished it off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Offensively the Nationals couldn’t get anything going, only managing five hits and just three for extra bases. Bryce Harper and Ryan Zimmerman cooled off going a combined 0 for 7 with a walk. While Adam LaRoche continued to look for his first hit of the season tacking on three more hitless at-bats running his total to 14 to start the season.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The lone bright spot of the night for the Nationals was<br/>
Danny Espinosa finally getting it going on offense. Espinosa entered the game 0<br/>
for 11 with three strikeouts, but went 2 for 4 tonight with a double.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals look to get back on track tomorrow with Ross<br/>
Detwiler making his first start of the season squaring off against Mike Leake.</p>

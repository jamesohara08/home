<h1>He Said She Said Fall Break</h1><b>October 16, 2013 Originally published in Collegiate Times with companion She Said</b><p>Fall break is such a tease. It’s like if Kate Upton was your girlfriend, but you were never allowed to see her in person. Excuse me if I don’t get excited about what is just a glorified three-day weekend. </p><p>The problem is that with where Blacksburg is located, it’s nearly impossible to do anything in just three days without feeling rushed. </p><p>Three days is just enough time to get home, do some laundry, say hi to some friends you haven’t seen in a couple months and then drive back, all while stressing over the piles of schoolwork that are waiting for you back in Blacksburg. </p><p>It would be one thing if professors weren’t allowed to assign work over the break, then it would be easier to relax. But that’s an unreasonable request to make that would never be fulfilled anyways. </p><p>Most students seem to figure this out after their freshmen year. As fairly educated people they learn from past experiences and try not to repeat mistakes. But not everyone learns so quickly. </p><p>As a senior, I still have friends who are going home for the weekend or trying to round up people to take a trip to the beach. Taking such a short vacation is only going to leave you more stressed than when you left. It’s a no-win proposition. </p><p>Just treat this like a normal weekend, and perhaps take advantage of the football team having a bye week this week to explore a part of Blacksburg or the New River Valley that you haven’t gotten to yet. Check off something on that Hokie bucket list you made as a freshman. </p><p>Trust me, not having to waste multiple hours of your weekend just to get to and from your destination will make you so much happier. There are so many wonderful places to explore and new experiences to enjoy within a couple minutes of campus. </p><p>So don’t fall for the false promise that is Fall Break. Take some time for yourself, learn more about your immediate surroundings and make sure you don’t make your future-self miserable by leaving them a mountain of work to do next week.</p>

<h1>Game #10 Recap: Nats Let One Slip Away</h1><b>April 13, 2013</b><div class="entry-content">
<p class="MsoNormal">In the first of 19 match-ups between the titans of the NL<br/>
East, the Washington Nationals and Atlanta Braves, what seemed like a statement<br/>
game from the Nats turned into a nightmare. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals entered the eighth inning with a 4-1 lead on<br/>
the strength of Bryce Harper’s fifth home run on the year, RBIs from Jayson<br/>
Werth and Denard Span and Ross Detwiler’s efficient domination of the Braves<br/>
hitters over seven innings. Detwiler continued to show how much he has evolved as a pitcher, shutting down one of the most potent line-ups in the majors for seven full innings, allowing only four hits and dealing five strikeouts. It was an outing completely undeserving of the no decision it was assigned.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Davey Johnson turned to his bullpen aces in the eighth and<br/>
that’s when the trouble started. Usually reliable Tyler Clippard could only<br/>
record two outs on 35 pitches, giving up an earned run in the process and leaving<br/>
with the bases loaded. After Rafael Soriano closed out the last three games Johnson<br/>
decided to turn to Drew Storen to close out the game instead. Storen managed to<br/>
get the last out in the eighth extinguishing that fire, but immediately found<br/>
trouble of his own in the ninth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Storen loaded the bases with a walk to BJ Upton and faced<br/>
Justin Upton. Upton grounded to third on what should’ve only allowed one run<br/>
and could’ve been the last out of the game. However, Ryan Zimmerman, playing in<br/>
the 1,000 game of his career, threw a ball intended for second base into left<br/>
field and the Braves managed to tie it up before the inning ended on the next<br/>
batter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals were unable to walk-off in the ninth so the<br/>
game entered extra innings. Craig Stammen, the Nats extra innings extraordinaire, came in<br/>
and struggled as well, giving up a two-run home run to Ramiro Pena to give the<br/>
Braves the lead. That was all she wrote for the Nats as Craig Kimbrel shut<br/>
the Nats out in the bottom of the innings securing the save and the win for the<br/>
Braves.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nationals look to get back on top in the second game of<br/>
the three game series tomorrow at 1:05 as ace Stephen Strasburg takes the<br/>
mound.</p>

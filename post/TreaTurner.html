<h1>Trea Turner</h1><b>August 25, 2015</b><p>Last Friday the Washington Nationals made a surprise move by calling up top position player prospect, shortstop Trea Turner, from AAA Syracuse. Turner, a consensus top 100 prospect in MLB, had been tearing up AA (.879 OPS in 41 plate appearances) and AAA (.784 OPS in 205 plate appearances). </p><p>He’s been dubbed the Nationals’ starting shortstop of the future but so far he’s seen limited action in his first couple days with the Nats, going 0-3 at the plate while playing 2.2 innings at shortstop in two games. With Ian Desmond experiencing a resurgence, he’s sporting a 133 wRC+ since the all-star break, starting opportunities will be hard to come by. And on top of that Danny Espinosa has locked down the main utility infielder role, but that doesn’t mean there’s no room for the 22 year old rookie. </p><p>Turner has been spending some time at second base recently, both in AAA prior to his call-up and in pregame workouts, so that improves his positional flexibility when he’s needed in the field. However, his main value to the Nationals won’t come as a starter or fill-in this year, but rather as a pinch hitter and pinch runner. </p><p>The hitter side is still a bit suspect, despite the gaudy numbers he’s put up in the minors. The plate discipline is still coming along as Turner only had a 6.3 percent walk rate to a 20.0 percent strikeout rate at AAA. FanGraphs’ depth chart projections expect those to be a 5.4 percent walk rate and 23.5 percent strikeout rate in the Majors, both below average. And Turner’s slight frame does not lend itself to power, as he only has three home runs this year in the Nationals system.</p><p>But where Turner makes his name is his speed. Kiley McDaniel of FanGraphs gave him a 70 grade for speed which comes out to plus plus in scout speak, or significantly above average. A player who can hit 30-35 home runs is said to have 70 grade power, so that’s a significant tool Turner has in his belt. </p><p>Among qualified hitters this season, the correlation coefficient between Bill James’ speed score, a rudimentary measure of a player’s speed, and their number of infield hits is .51. In other words, faster players can beat out more infield hits, not new knowledge, but something that can help Turner up his batting average as a pinch hitter. </p><p>Of course Turner’s speed will help him most on the base paths. So far in the minors he’s had some opportunities to show off his abilities, he has 69 stolen base attempts in his two minor league seasons between the Padres and Nationals. However, in those limited opportunities he’s exceled, with an 85.5 percent success rate on stolen base attempts. Among current Nationals with multiple stolen base attempts, only Denard Span has a higher success rate this season, safely swiping 11 bags in 11 attempts. </p><div class="w3-responsive"><table class="w3-table-all"><tr><td><p>Name</p></td><td><p>SB</p></td><td><p>CS</p></td><td><p>SB%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Denard Span</p></td><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>100.0%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Michael Taylor</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>83.3%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ian Desmond</p></td><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>78.6%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Danny Espinosa</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>71.4%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bryce Harper</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>55.6%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Yunel Escobar</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>50.0%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Anthony Rendon</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>33.3%</p></td></tr></div></table><p>With Ryan Zimmerman, Yunel Escobar, Wilson Ramos and Jayson Werth all getting regular at-bats without contributing much in the running game and top bench options Clint Robinson and Jose Lobaton also not being known as fleet of foot, there is a big opportunity for Turner to make an impact late in games. That role would be similar to the one Terrance Gore of the Kansas City Royals had last season. Gore had eight stolen bases and scored seven runs down the stretch and in the playoffs, despite only having two plate appearances. One or two extra runs could be the difference for the Nationals, who find themselves trailing the New York Mets by 5.5 games with few left to play. </p>

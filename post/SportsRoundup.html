<h1>Sports Roundup</h1><b>July 04, 2011</b><p>Yesterday’s Big Story:  At Wimbledon Novak Djokovic won his third Grand Slam title, and first at the All England Club, by defeating top ranked Rafael Nadal in four sets.   Djokovic should the poise and all around excellence that had him win start the year off 41-0, winning the match 6-4, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3.  With his win Djokovic will rise to No. 1 in the ATP rankings, overtaking Nadal and Roger Federer, considered by many to be the greatest of all time.</p><p>Yesterday’s Star – Michael Morse, 1B, Washington Nationals:  Morse is one of five candidates up for the MLB All-Star Game final vote along with Shane Victorino, Ian Kennedy, Andre Ethier, and Todd Helton.  As a D.C. centric blog we highly recommend that you go out and vote for Morse to earn a well-deserved All Star Game selection.</p><p>Yesterday’s Fail – It was Nickelodeon Day at Nationals Park yesterday for reasons unknown, which meant some of their most popular characters were at the game.  Unfortunately somebody made the SpongeBob SquarePants costume too big and he had a lot of trouble maneuvering his way down to the field and back up.  Nationals Inquisition has pictures: <a href="http://www.natsnq.com/?p=6045">http://www.natsnq.com/?p=6045</a></p><p>Yesterday in Washington - The Nationals lost a rather forgettable game to the Pirates 10-2 as Jason Marquis was chased from the game before getting out of the second inning.  The Nationals fell to 2-5 under new manager Davey Johnson, no doubt leading to a few internet commenters calling for him to be fired.</p><p>Today in Washington – The Nationals break open a new series against the Chicago Cubs with an unusual Monday day game;  Jordan Zimmermann will be going for the Nats, looking to continue his 11 game streak of quality starts.  Also it will be America’s birthday, so enjoy the holiday and Go America!</p>

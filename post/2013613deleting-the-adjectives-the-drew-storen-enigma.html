<p>When the Nationals signed Rafael Soriano this offseason it supposedly set up a nigh unbeatable triumvirate in the bullpen of Soriano, Drew Storen and Tyler Clippard. All were elite relievers who had experience closing out games,<br/>
combined they would shut down opponents in the later innings.</p>
<p>But that hasn’t been the case this season. All three have had their struggles, but none as much as Storen. Just a<br/>
year away from a 43 save season Storen currently has a 4.85 ERA, 4.14 FIP and 1.54 WHIP.  While not in the closer role this season Storen already has three blown saves, just two less than in 2011 when he was the full-time closer.<br/>
Storen isn’t that bad, his talent was not suddenly stolen away from him by the aliens of Moron Mountain, so why is he having so much trouble this year?</p>
<p>Some postulated earlier in the season that he was still shell shocked from his blown save in Game 5 of the NLDS.<br/>
While that was certainly a heartbreaking moment that likely took a while to get over, it is highly unlikely that a professional would let it affect him eight months later.</p>
<p>Looking at his peripheral stats there is nothing that stands out as an issue. His 8.31 K/9 and 2.42 BB/9 are right<br/>
around his career averages. He is giving up a few more home runs, his HR/9 is 1.38, but that alone isn’t enough to explain how he is struggling this much.</p>
<p>What does stand out is that opponents have a .358 batting average on balls in play against Storen this year,<br/>
significantly higher than his career average of .282. This inflated BABIP suggests that Storen could be a victim of bad luck and when we peel back further we can see more evidence of this.</p>
<p>Looking at his batted ball data on Fangraphs, Storen is giving up the same type of contact as he was before. His<br/>
1.62 ground ball to fly ball ratio is right around his career average of 1.33 and isn’t close to being a problem. Where Storen is having trouble though is infield hits, 9.5% of ground balls he has allowed have been an infield hit. For<br/>
comparison’s sake, Ichiro Suzuki, who was one of the best at beating out infield hits, has a career IFH% of 12.5%. So an inordinate amount of batters are getting on-base even when Storen induces weak contact.</p>
<p>But chalking it up to bad luck and calling it a day is too simple. There’s one more difference between this year and<br/>
previous seasons for Storen. Both PITCHf/x and Baseball Info Solutions agree that he is using his fastball significantly less than in previous years with his change-up use rising accordingly. In 2011 and 2012 Storen threw his<br/>
fastball around 64.9% and 71.4% of the time, but he’s only throwing it 56.1% of the time this season. With his slider rate staying mostly the same he has been using his change-up more, 15.7% of the time versus a career average of 3.5%.</p>
<p>It’s certainly possible that Storen is trying a new approach in attacking hitters that is leading to the increase in<br/>
infield hits and home runs. However, with his K/9, BB/9 and GB/FB ratio not being substantially different as well it seems unlikely. SIERA, an ERA estimator that is a good measure of a pitcher’s underlying talent level agrees,<br/>
pegging Storen at a great 3.20. Look for the BABIP, IFH% and HR/9 rates to regress to Storen’s career averages as the season goes along and his big picture numbers to back to what’s expected of the talented reliever Storen<br/>
still is.</p>
<p>Want to read another good Nats blogger, who is almost as smart as me, come to the same conclusion by different<br/>
means? Then read <a href="http://natstradamus.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/what-the-hell-is-the-matter-with-drew-storen/">this</a> by Luigi de Guzman at Natstradamus.</p>

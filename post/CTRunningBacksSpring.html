<h1>CT Running Backs Spring</h1><b>April 24, 2014 Originally published in Collegiate Times</b><p>Just a season removed from quarterback Logan Thomas leading the Virginia Tech football team in rushing, the Hokies have a new problem with their running game, too many options. </p><p>Even without their starting running back Trey Edmunds, who is sitting out spring practice with a leg injury, the Hokies have had their hands filled trying to get everyone enough touches. </p><p>Four running backs received carries in the previous year: starter J.C. Coleman, primary backup Joel Caleb, Chris Mangus and Jerome Wright. However, the most impressive back this spring has been early enrollee Marshawn Williams. </p><p>“He’s had a great spring and he’s going to be a really good back so we’re excited about him,” said offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler. “Big, powerful, smart, not a freshman, makes people miss, balance, run through an arm tackle. It was a pleasant surprise, it’s really good to see a back run through arm tackles and make someone miss at that age in particular so it’s very exciting.”</p><p>With the Hokies breaking in a new starting quarterback this year, they’ll likely rely more on the running backs to fuel the offense. Before that happens though, they’ll need to find a more defined pecking order before the season starts.</p><p>“Everything is spread out so equally and competition is going so good for everyone,” Williams said. “It’s good, it makes all of us better.”</p><p>Over the last two seasons Coleman has taken 31.1% of all carries by Hokie running backs and figures to continue to be a large part of the Tech running game. At 5 feet 7 inches and 191 pounds Coleman will never be an every down back, but can be a change of pace from the bruising Edmunds.</p><p>Caleb was a four star recruit as an athlete in 2012 and worked as a receiver his redshirt freshman year before moving over to running back in 2013. His considerable raw athleticism is tantalizing if the Hokies can harness it and running backs coach Shane Beamer has liked what he’s seen this year.</p><p>“He’s a lot better,” Beamer said. “We’ve really challenged him to play lower. He always used to play too high. So he’s playing lower and I think he’s playing a lot more physical too, he’s lowering his shoulder and he’s running through people.”</p><p>Caleb’s previous work at receiver could particularly help the Hokies in the passing game, running backs accounted for 22.2% of Tech’s receptions in 2013. </p><p>Mangus similarly could be a threat in the passing game, he averaged 8.0 yards per catch on nine receptions last season.</p><p>The odd man out may be Williams. Despite his considerable talent he is a good candidate to redshirt along with fellow early enrollee Shai McKenzie. That hasn’t stopped the Tech coaches from raving about him. </p><p>“I’ve been impressed with him the whole time,” said head coach Frank Beamer. “He studies it, he learns his assignment, he’s very polite, good character kid and I like the way he plays football. I don’t want to say too much too soon, but I think he’s the real package.”</p><p>As with the quarterback competition the Hokies won’t need to make a final decision until the fall and will likely have a much clearer picture once the actual games begin. </p><p>“Right now I think that depth chart is changing every day,” Shane Beamer said. “We’re constantly evaluating after every practice.”</p><p>Last fall the Hokies seemed to be in a similar situation with Edmunds, Coleman and senior Tony Gregory, before injuries to Coleman and Gregory left Edumnds as the only healthy back for the season opener. </p><p>Whoever the Hokies choose, they have a plan for success that for the most part has eluded them the past two seasons. </p><p>“We always talk to the running backs about every time you’re running the football you’re delivering body blows,” Shane Beamer said. “And by the time that fourth quarter comes around you’re ready for that knockout punch.” </p>

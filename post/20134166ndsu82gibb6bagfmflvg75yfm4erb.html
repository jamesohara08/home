<h1>Game #14 Recap: Weakened Nats Get Rolled by Marlins</h1><b>April 17, 2013</b><div class="entry-content">
<p class="MsoNormal">With a stomach bug afflicting two-thirds of their starting<br/>
outfield the Washington Nationals came in at below full strength against the<br/>
Miami Marlins. The offense struggled to produce missing on-base wizard Denard<br/>
Span and phenom Bryce Harper and another rocky start by Dan Haren let the<br/>
Marlins roll with an 8-2 win. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Haren, in his third start of the year, was rolling through<br/>
three innings, allowing only one hit on just 37 pitches. After getting the<br/>
first out of the fourth inning, Haren induced an easy ground ball to third from<br/>
Placido Polanco. But Ryan Zimmerman airmailed the throw to first, picking up his<br/>
fourth error on the season, and the trouble began. Two singles, a groundout and<br/>
a home run by Adeiny Hechavarria later and the Nats had dug themselves into a<br/>
4-0 hole. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Things didn’t get any better for Haren in the fifth inning<br/>
as he was only able to record one out before loading the bases and giving up<br/>
another run on a walk to Greg Dobbs. That was enough for Davey Johnson as he<br/>
pulled Haren in favor of reliever Craig Stammen. Stammen gave up a double to<br/>
add two more runs to Haren’s tally, before finally finishing off the inning.<br/>
Haren finished the game giving up seven runs, three earned, on seven hits, a<br/>
walk and two strikeouts. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Nats offense finally got something going in the top of<br/>
the sixth inning when back-to-back doubles by Tyler Moore and Steve Lombardozzi<br/>
scored two runs. But it was too little, too late for the Nationals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Marlins scored another run in the seventh on a Greg<br/>
Dobbs single to extend their lead, but at that point it was never in doubt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the loss the Nationals dropped to 8-6 on the season.<br/>
The Nats look to take the rubber match tomorrow in a match-up between Ross<br/>
Detwiler and Nats-killer Ricky Nolasco. </p>

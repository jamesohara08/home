<h1>Tanner Roark</h1><b>March 31, 2015</b><p>When the Washington Nationals signed Max Scherzer to a seven year, $210 million contract to be their new staff ace, a number of players were affected, but none moreso than Tanner Roark. Roark, who had just authored an excellent 198.2 inning, 2.85 ERA, 3.47 FIP campaign in his first full year as a starter, was pushed out of the 2015 rotation. However, with the Nationals controlling Roark for the next five seasons, he is still a clear piece of their future plans. To that end Roark will likely find himself in the Nats bullpen to start the season. </p><p>The big question for the Nats and Roark is how he’ll fit into the bullpen: as a long reliever or as a set up man? Based on the Nationals usage of Roark so far this spring, they don’t seem to have a good answer themselves yet, having him come out of the pen in a number of different ways. As James Wagner <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/wp/2015/03/27/how-the-nationals-may-use-tanner-roark-this-season/">detailed on Friday</a>:	</p><p>“Early in spring training games, Roark was tossing multiple innings in relief of starters, as much as 2 2/3 innings in one outing. He threw two innings on March 19. But the Nationals wanted Roark to get a different experience out of the bullpen, so they had him come in mid-inning earlier this week against the Tigers and then take the mound in the next frame. On Thursday, Roark tossed one inning only, the sixth.”</p><p>Roark isn’t completely new to the bullpen though, as he threw 22.2 innings out of the pen in 2013 after getting his first callup to the Majors. In his previous season Roark slotted into a long relief role, with eight of his nine relief appearances going for multiple innings. His only other relief experience came in the playoffs in 2014, when he pitched multiple innings in relief of Gio Gonzalez in the pivotal Game 4. So the little experience Roark does have in the pen has come in a long relief role.</p><p>With such a small sample it’s difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions about how well Roark can do in the bullpen from his overall numbers, but there is one number that can stabilize in so few innings: fastball velocity. In 2013, Roark had an average fastball velocity of 93.1 miles per hour as a reliever, nearly one mile per hour above his average fastball velocity of 92.2 miles per hour in 31.0 innings as a starter. While many pitchers see a similar increase in their average fastball velocity transitioning from the rotation to being a single inning reliever, Roark showed an ability to gain velocity despite still throwing multiple innings in relief.</p><p>However, while Roark has successful experience as a long reliever; that might not be the best spot for him as he looks to stay in the Nationals future plans. Last season, the Nats faced a similar situation with left handed starter-turned-reliever Ross Detwiler. Detwiler was beaten out by Roark and Taylor Jordan for a spot in the rotation and took over a long relief role in the Nationals bullpen, with the expectation that he would also provide key rotation depth. But the Nats struggled to find Detwiler regular innings, 22 of his 47 appearances came after three or more days of rest, and his performance suffered for it. Detwiler put up a 4.00 ERA and 4.16 FIP in 63 innings before being shipped out to the Texas Rangers for a pair of lottery ticket prospects this offseason. That’s not a situation the Nats would like to repeat with Roark.</p><p>The best role model for how the Nats should incorporate Roark into their bullpen comes from his own team, Craig Stammen. After failing as a starter, Stammen took on a full-time relief role in 2012 and excelled to the tune of a 2.34 ERA and 3.45 FIP in 88.1 innings pitched, second most in MLB among relievers. That season the Nationals were able to strike a perfect balance between Stammen’s ability to throw multiple innings with a healthy regular schedule. In his 59 appearances that season, Stammen threw multiple innings in 35 of them, but only 19 of them came on three or more days of rest. Stammen continued to be a valuable member of the Nationals bullpen in 2013 and 2014, accumulating 1.7 wins above replacement by FanGraphs.</p><p>As a starter Roark has proven that he can be highly successful while throwing multiple innings and facing a lineup more than once. The Nationals will be at their best when they are able to take advantage of that ability. However, he also shouldn’t be shoehorned into a traditional relief role, as he’s likely one of the three best pitchers in the Nats bullpen and irregular usage, like Detwiler had, would be a waste of talent. The Nationals need to take advantage of the best of both worlds, as they did with Stammen, to maximize the advantage they created by pushing Roark to the bullpen.</p>

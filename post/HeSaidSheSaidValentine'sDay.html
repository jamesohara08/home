<h1>He Said She Said Valentine's Day</h1><b>February 13, 2014 Originally published in Collegiate Times with companion She Said</b><p>This week on “he said, she said” we have a very special episode on Valentine’s Day. Personally, I couldn’t care less.</p><p>Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate Valentine’s Day. I’m not going to run around screaming about how it’s a made-up holiday created by Hallmark to sell cards. That’s a cliché. </p><p>No, instead, I’m just ambivalent to the day. If someone wanted to celebrate it with me I would, but I’m not going to push to have some sort of special day. </p><p>Luckily for me, my girlfriend is not a fan of Valentine’s Day. In her words, couples shouldn’t have to have a day to tell their partner they care about them that should be an everyday occurrence. </p><p>I’m fairly certain this is what she actually believes. Hopefully, this isn’t one of those situations where someone says they don’t want something despite clearly expecting it. Otherwise, she will be sorely disappointed. </p><p>Anyways, Valentine’s Day does have one clear benefit, and that is that there are no other real holidays in February. No, Groundhog Day does not count. The only good thing about Groundhog Day is the Bill Murray movie. </p><p>This confuses me though. February is by far the dreariest month of the year. The fun of snow and winter has been gotten over in January, and now there’s an entire month teasing you before spring begins. Shouldn’t this be when we have more designated days of cheer? </p><p>In a roundabout way I’m using this column about Valentine’s Day to start my campaign for more holidays in February. Sure, it is the shortest month of the year by days, but that clearly isn’t enough, we demand more. </p><p>The beloved NBC comedy 30 Rock had the right idea when they devoted an episode to creating a celebration for Leap Day. The celebration is complete with the magical Leap Day William who lives in the Mariana Trench and trades candy for children’s tears, while celebrators wear the traditional blue and yellow garb. </p><p>Still, Leap Day only comes around once every four years. We really need more consistent holiday cheer and not just some that is reserved for couples. I hope you join me in this righteous quest. </p>
